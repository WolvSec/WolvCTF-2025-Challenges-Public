# The Void

The Void enjoys consuming.

This may be a solution to the growing trash problem around the world. 

Just feed the Void your trash!

It is very picky however, and will only eat cardboard or paper.

Give some of the examples a try!

(Note for hosting, run ./split_model.sh combine before running the docker container.)

I wouldn't expect anyone to solve this with a script. It's not very technical, but it does take some elbow grease. We could scrap this challenge if it's too annoying of a solve.

To solve:
The flight numbers are grouped by letter.

Lookup each flight number and "plot" a line on a map (realistically you could just eyeball it).

Each grouping of flights comes together to form a letter when viewed on a map.



Assemble the letters in order for the flag

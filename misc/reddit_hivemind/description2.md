Nice work on the previous challenge! You managed to figure out how to upvote and downvote according to reddiquette

We are one step away from bathing in reddit karma.

Let's make sure we know what NOT to do, though, and try an experiment to get downvoted..

Leave a comment that would get downvoted by r/nba, making sure it includes the word harden. (The name of current Clippers superstar James Harden)

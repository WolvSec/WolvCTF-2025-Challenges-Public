"Shit you're right Harden should have just not answered the question the reporter asked him.  He should have just said ""next question"" like Westbrook.  Smh.  He answered a question a reporter asked him after a referee CONFIRMED they missed calls."

These players are so old. Theyre getting hurt every five seconds. Ew
Make Atlantahawks Goodenoughto loseinthe2ndround Again
Man it's straight up ridiculous. I got downvoted for saying people are overreacting and the game is trash and another dude in the game thread was - 45 for saying he still thinks the bucks will win. This place becomes cancer during playoffs
#NO ONE HAS SEEN CP3 AND STALIN ON THE SAME COURT TOGETHER. IM JUST ASKING QUESTIONS!
"After all that, we're somehow leading in point differential for the series."
Lmfao Paul pierce said this series was over after one game
They really brought a stretcher out? For an eye injury?
I‚Äôm not even a little bit biased but I sure hope so
"Lol no one else gets to use that excuse when it happens. Dame's played one non top 5 defense in his entire career before this nuggets team, and it was the rockets. And we all know how that ended."
That's gotta be some kind of illusion right? Can't be real right fuck
"Yeah, he's an amazing player and can score from anywhere. It sucks when you're watching him and one possession he makes a jaw dropping move to score and the next one he flops and shoots free throws."

Harden will be ruled out the rest of this series. 

Rockets lose this game and the next. 

Shumpert averages 60 points in the next 4 games and the Rockets eliminate the Warriors.

Edit: You're welcome Houston. I single-handedly brought Harden back."
Right. He should‚Äôve said TMac and York
"If I remember right, game 3 are set way ahead of time.  If you finish a series early at best only the time line for the first 2 games moves up.

This prevents a team from sweeping then getting like 2 weeks rest while the other team in the finals had a bunch of 7 game series and no rest at all until finals."
Fuck the warriors. Lebrons eye last year too. They zazad before and tried it on him now this.... is this shit intentional??
Death has many faces
Rockets gonna get all the calls tonight
"also worth noting that the only reason illegal immigrants are housed in such terrible conditions is because there are too many and the facilities are not built for all those people. So if one wants to improve the conditions of these detainment centers, one must limit the amount of illegal immigration. Just so happens that a wall is an efficient way of doing so."
"12 offensive rebounds for GSW

.... thats fucked up"
Probably higher than 9
I am honestly surprised how many people want the celtics to win on this sub. Everyone always acts like theyre one of the most hated teams on here

"It is both cold and fire, shoutout Jon Snow"
Clippers seem like a good choice. Living in LA I can promise you that no one would miss them. Maybe like 12 people. I think they would be much more profitable for the league as the Seattle SuperSonics.

"IRONY, am I right?"
But r/nba told me he's flopping again and purposely making his team lose
"Damn, that's dope, I'm a Rockets fan now. Morey is the GOAT, always ahead of the curve. Meanwhile I'm watching Jayson Tatum launch fading long twos."
The oldest man on the court took on JaVale's rim-runner position for the Warriors.
"Last year there was a faulty stat on r/nba going around that we were 0-13 and it went repeated and unchecked for a long time.

No he‚Äôs a trail blazer
Harden is saving face. He will be back.
being unsupportive = pointing out that the league loses 10s of millions of dollars a year and that those players crying sexism when they aren't paid more is ridiculous
"Well that took an unexpected turn at the end.

If he didn‚Äôt go off in the 1st half we wouldn‚Äôt be in it at all. Huge game
"This series would be 10x better without KD, only dubs fans will disagree"
Chuck would destroy Trump in an actual debate.
Holy shit I forgot about that
Shoutout to the people making fun of Harden's injury. Y'all fucking trash and have obviously never actually been able to developed any form of appreciation for sports. Fake fans.
And when he poked lebrons eye
god I literally cannot wait for this to be deleted
Fuck Giannis‚Äôs game. Ref ball
maybe a wheelchair wasn't available
Yeah i remember that Amare game with shot after the buzzer. Wished the Knicks could have been more competitive but they ran into the brick wall that was the Heat as well as injuries preventing them from reaching their potential. I'm still mad they traded the farm for Melo when they could have waited for the offseason. Really makes me hope the Lakers dont make the same mistake.
Enjoy your big ol San Antonio women

"It sucks how this is a serious injury but its gonna get memed so hard bc it looks lowkey like tears, hope Harden gets better :("
Nah he still got stuffed by a 6‚Äô2 point guard. Now he‚Äôs just doing his job. If he had been doing it earlier maybe they wouldn‚Äôt be down double digits.
"It‚Äôs Lebron and Harden, that should be expected"
THEY FUCKING DID IT BRAVO

"Lol c'mon man. Again with this?...Enes is like that person that says ""I love you"" way too early in the relationship or while the person they're saying it to is thinking of breaking up with them"
"They can‚Äôt miss from 3 and Kyrie ain‚Äôt hitting yet and they‚Äôre barely in the lead, we‚Äôre gonna take this one"
Is it just me or does Giannis travel a lot
their career AST/TO ratios are similar and im not a 40 year old football fan that has something against players celebrating
Interesting that Harden comes back onto the court when the score is at 31 and 27 the two numbers that have haunted these two franchises
"&gt;Translation: Bucks are on fire tonight, perfect 5/7"
"Thats not what I meant but i can see how it was misinterpreted that way. I was saying the reason people called it a flop is because he has a reputation of being a flopper.  
  
i definitely think it was a foul."
Can't drop 50 if it's a blowout by the end of the 3rd and he only plays 30 minutes.... shit.
Celtics strat of punching and clotheslineing Giannis to wind him before his fts seems to be working well. Ref's will also get bored calling the fouls in the 2nd and we'll get killed while Tatum and brown get touch fouls kill me.
"I mean, if we don't do something about illegal immigration it will affect all of us more and more.  Illegal immigration drives down wages, drives up unemployment drives up healthcare costs, increases taxes, lowers educational standards... I'm *all* for legal immigration, nobody can possibly make an argument that illegal immigration is GOOD for citizens of the US.

I'm all for the wall, even if it helps the problem marginally.  Any help we can get would be huge."
"I don‚Äôt think kd flops, his arms are just so long that the second a hand is out he can rip through and draw contact. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not a shooting foul."
"Sorry KD, we had to sign Tobias when we had the chance. Franchise move."
Knock on wood but refs have been pretty damn good this game
"It's just Harden fans reaching for straws. If they were really being honest, they would probably agree they aren't thrilled with his antics.

I think the most interesting thing to watch for in the coming years, if the NBA legislates all of Harden's antics out of the game, how good he can be without them.

I'm sure he will still be really good, but it would be crazy to see him become a regular all star and people having to admit he was only a top 5 player due to his antics."
Thanks to all the refs tonight. We couldn‚Äôt have won this game by * squints * 21 points without them‚Ä¶
You can‚Äôt set Chuck up like that.
"Honestly I‚Äôm glad people are catching on lmao 

He‚Äôs gotta be like 12 and here to just troll"
Fuck the refs lmao absolute robbery
Yes bc he got poked in the eye. I don‚Äôt believe his eye was fucking bleeding. Don‚Äôt believe anything MDA says
You ever seen a dead body? I swear they're the biggest floppers you'll ever see
"It happened right in front of the ref, how can he not call that foul?"
And yet he gets millions in endorsements and you watch his commercials daily. It‚Äôs almost like this sub isn‚Äôt representative of NBA fans.
"Yeah.  Now if he consistently shoots it close to 40% for like a season and continues to shoot it well these playoffs, then maybe you think about taking it away, but still... he shoots like 70% at the rim.  He'd have to really turn into Steph Curry for you to prefer him driving to shooting 3s."
"Warriors are worse without KD. 

They‚Äôll be fine in reg season but they‚Äôll need him in the playoffs because he‚Äôs been carrying them"
Lmao the contact on Kyrie is way more blatant than the shit on Giannis
That girl's reaction always gets me
"Interesting how GSW fans cheer when a player is down. Sure he might flop in the past, but come on"
Tiny Tim deserves a Tiny T
Just ask Doc. He knows.
Damn Harden sure is committing to that flop eh
I got a shorter summary for you: middlegod
I mean that‚Äôs accurate regardless of sample
"I wish there was like a high karma only thread, there are some good warriors fans I wouldn‚Äôt mind talking to but there‚Äôs way more 4 month old accounts in here"
"Damn, those boxing matches games are the worst. You have Boston grinding every possession to get points and then they go the other way and it's either Giannis getting every call or people hitting every three. I was thousands of kilometeres away from the arena watching this and even I was triggered seeing Bucks hit every 3 pointer they shot, I can't even imagine how much more triggered Celtics' players must have been seeing them hit every shot despite good defense. I actually feel proud that it took 2 and a half quarter for Celtics to lose their temper and trade blows"
Party time out in the plaza.
So I guess harden just fuckin died?
Please have Harden come back with a pirate eye patch!
kanter‚Äôs that dude that goes on a date and is sure he‚Äôs in love.
He's been around his last season average after the first couple of months that were horrendous. Still a long way to go of course but he's obviously putting in the work.
"I know about that injury, but he used to drive into contact early in his career. He made adjustments  where is your wizards flair?"
Is this satire or the worst argument I‚Äôve ever scene in my life
"I hope he doesn't go down the same path as Michael Beasley. Beasley always seemed like a guy who had immense potential, but I think his struggle with stress/depression really hindered him taking that next step. The guy even had to check into rehab early in his career. 

Hope Montrezl has someone who's there helping him pull it together and just being there for him. The guy is crazy good, I'd hate to see anything impact him right as his career is about to take off."
Straight up for AD who says no?
If any of you have been smacked in the eye you know that shit hurts like hell.
Giannis shimmy perfectly summed the game.
Absolutely. Those who defended him got down voted as people were on a moral crusade saying it was impossible for him to slip up while speaking and clearly he decided to randomly go fully rogue and be racist to Chinese people while knowing he's on camera
"Omega is phonetically a long O sound, and Nai means yes"

He can get some reps in with the Herd in Oshkosh if he wants
"FaKe ToP SeEd

Seriously, can we stop overreacting to 1 game every fucking series?

The amount of articles and shit I saw saying Milwaukee needed to adjust their game and style after one fucking game was insane

Yea, a team should just abandon the game they developed which got the the most wins in the NBA and swept the first round"
I'm here to overreact.

"is it me or was KD like ""GOD DAMN"" when he saw harden's face during the inbounds"
"Yeah. It's actually not as bad as people think. Mormons are weird people, but not all of them want to talk about God and Jesus all the time. A lot of them just want to chill and enjoy life."
"But if you are being honest and look at it from the perspective of nba players, he is exactly the type of guy you would want to negotiate terms for you and represent you in front of the league, because he is that dirty and doesn‚Äôt think twice to make use of anything that gives him (and all players) an advantage."
Harden is nothing more than a decent role player when forced to play actual basketball.
"He didn‚Äôt try to do that either. Rape implies that there was penetration, he forced her to give him oral sex. That‚Äôs sexual assault not rape. He was found guilty of forced oral sodomy."
"I said he wouldn't be as good as Trez before the series started and got downvoted. If Trez was in Capelas spot rn, the Rockets would be terrifying for the Warriors."
Reading the comments putting down the Bucks earlier is making this nice to watch.
He should stay in Wisconsin and figure out his shot
Yet another oppenent injury on Golden State‚Äôs path to the Finals....
Chill. He was writhing on the ground like we've seen a hundred times before.
"That's what I did, I'm also gonna reach out to some of the Clippers players on social media right now since they can probably help him more than a random fan like me."
Does Pat have a history of doing this? Nope. Draymond does

"Well shucks, thanks man. Much love right back. In all honesty I'm biased for my teams. I think Dream has an argument for GOAT (with college included), I think Harden should have at least 2 MVPs, Astros will probably win the world series, etc... but I really wanted to see this clip and when I commented it was quite buried. One of the things I love most about reddit is that it gives us the source material without us having to work too hard for it. And for that we should upvote for visibility

Edit: Spelling"
"must be nice to hit threes.

can't relate"
"Instead of showing the league he's for real, Giannis is proving to be a choker"
Even you don‚Äôt believe this
that was a clean block
"Love it, bucks fans coming out of the woodwork..

Calling it now Celts in 6, cuz fuck the bucks."
Chris Webber‚Äôs commentary adds absolutely nothing to the game
this is so under-stated. The raptors front office during those years were terrible and never made the team competitive.
Warriors ruined the Nba..
Chris Paul's flop was so goofy lol he's completely shameless. Fell down like he'd been shot and then looked at the ref. Just play the damn game
"Ignoring whether or not the game was rigged, I think it's fair to acknowledge that the refs have the ability to put a team in a position to gain momentum or lose it. For example, in game 4 of the 2017 finals, a bunch of the Warriors got into foul trouble during the 1st quarter. A bunch of the calls were pretty weak and even if they were all legit, it was inconsistent with how physically they had been letting those 3 series be played. 

In general, people are fouling all over the place. Refs can make correct calls to get players into foul trouble or choose between killing and allowing transition opportunities. Given how much easier it is to score in transition, all it takes is a short series of defensive ""stops"" combined with transition opportunities to create a 10 point swing. 

This is what happened in game 7. The Rockets were phenomenal on defense and the Warriors were struggling to score in the half court. Then sometime towards the end of the 3rd, early 4th, the Warriors had a series of physical defensive plays on Rockets drives that led to transition buckets and a momentum shift. I'm pretty sure that there were legit fouls on some of those plays that the refs could have called. It not only erased potential points from the Rockets, but also helped the Warriors score when they were having serious trouble against the Rockets defense. And while 0-27 is very real, I have to guess that part of the reason they favored the 3 ball so much at the end was that they weren't having success on those drives."
Dislocated middle finger on left hand. They zoomed in on that TNT overtime channel.
I feel the opposite
The Bucks beat the Pistons aka the worst playoff team of the decade and are struggling versus the very good Celtics. Very Underwhelming performance by Giannis so far.
Holy fuck shut up about the refs already
Warriors awful from 3 at 25%. Rockets amazing at 46%.
No I‚Äôm not trying to downplay it at all. I just meant that it seemed like they were making everything I was shocked to see it wasn‚Äôt even 50%
to be real i am on niether of those two platforms so i have no idea who is the biggest. i do know there was valuation not long ago where reddit users were at the lowest of the barrel. but to act like reddit or this place especially doesn't originate and produce quality shit that ripples high volume throughout the nba industry is retarded.
"Interesting take, thanks r/nba"
I mean I imagine most teams do this. They spend millions on analytics departments and refs are a huge part of the game.
"Good, it's gone the other way enough times."
Celtics game plan has been EXPOSED. I doubt Brad Stevens can get them to bounce back from this. Bucks in 5 seems likely to me.
We don't talk about that guy anymore. Ol Kuz is an up and comer with a 6'9 250 tidal wave at his side.
"I DMd him. He probably won't see it, but I hope he pulls through."
Jaylen ‚ÄúJaylen Brown‚Äù Brown
"There's a difference between exaggerating contact and faking.

Neymar does both. Exaggerating contact isn't great but it's understandable.

The second is unacceptable and basically cheating."
"Derrick Rose, he won it for being the best scorer on a team that dominated the league because of their defence to win 61 games. You could argue that Lebron and Dwight Howard were better players that season but with the WL Record factored in Rose definitely had the strongest case for MVP and for that reason he won it."
On a side note last episode of GOT was shit
"Not gonna blame the refs for anything, but this is kinda ridiculous"
Yes it will. God bless all of you for sinking on this shitpost with me. Downvote for good luck.
Can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it but I could swear a basketball analyst on ESPN said this series was over and the Bucks were fucked. Hm.
"Dude giannis gets away with so much shit, atleast harden is crafty to draw fouls (and I‚Äôm not a harden fan at all) but giannis legit just bulldozes straight into people and gets calls"
"What I said in the last game thread, Small sample size"
"This mentality people have is stupid. People say the same thing about CP3 and he is the opposite of Westbrook. There is no prerequisite for being a ""championship player"".

Draymond Green is a championship player and people disrespect him by calling him a role player because he doesn't score.

Carmelo Anthony is the opposite of Draymond and they say he's not a championship player because he's just a scorer who doesn't do anything else."
"He‚Äôs not yourvydas. He‚Äôs not myvydas.

Literally the only thing he's known for.
wait I wanna see this list
"I really should have muted the game. It‚Äôs bad when I‚Äôm sitting here correcting them while laying on my couch, then I have to watch them eat wings during a break üòë"
He had 1 surgery to fix the patella fracture and another to emove the screws that were put in place to help heal the injury. Those same knees got infected from the screws.
"It's a fair question. He was around 30 at the time, working for his Dad, who really was the one running that business. From what I've read about that, it sounds like there potentially was some discrimination. However, there was never an admission of guilt as part of the settlement, another critical point. Say what you want, but it was never proven. So most Trump supporters look at this and say well I give him the benefit of the doubt given the mountain of good evidence in the following decades up til now."
"I always feel bad for Knicks, Suns, Wiz, etc. fans. You're just minding your own business and *boom*....random drive by insults."
"Looks dislocated to me

"I mean he‚Äôs had 2/6 good games.....

He can bounce back sure, but he‚Äôs so vastly overrated in the playoffs because he got to play next to LeBron, I‚Äôm just sick of the PLAYOFF KYRIE hype....."
Rockets are so lucky to be down just 9
"I don‚Äôt think you know what having a punchable face means bro lol has nothing to do with actually punching someone in the face 

See: Amy Schumer"
But it's all the refs' fault.
Draymond in the playoffs is a whole different animal.
"Hello, people of r/nba. This is just a daily reminder that Kevin Durant is far and away one of the most monumentally pathetic athletes in the history of recreational human activity. Never forget, and remember to drink your chocolate milk."
"""The Warriors team ‚Äî the organization ‚Äî sent the NBA a bunch of clips leading up to Game 3 (vs Clippers) of what they think is Patrick Beverley holding, clutching, grabbing‚Ä¶ pushing.""

When the Warriors don't like the calls they are getting, they complain to the league. Yet, when the Rockets complain to the league about the refs, they are somehow worse."
At this rate the Warriors can put up 150 or so just by bricking threes and having someone stand under the basket to slam it down on the incompetent Rocket rebounders.
Good news is I can‚Äôt see the Bucks winning in Boston so the C‚Äôs should be good
KD is a damn cheat code.
I‚Äôve had people in school tell me they would take TJ Mcconnell over CP3.
For the sake of this series
That's because he was a superstar. Top 3 big in the nba not even close.
"You've always had a Utah Jazz flair, why did you change your flair to OKC now?"
Draymond‚Äôs play deciding a series. Shocker
That's the exact same play they gave Harden an offensive foul on. Sorry but I can't accept that.
Houston Warriors game thread about to be the saltiest place in the milky way
Thompson. He lets Curry/Durant do all the work and he doesn't care at all
"If I'm a Celtics fan, I'm pretty frustrated at Stevens' refusal to call a timeout during that shitshow."
I mean the one on James looks real real bad. But this angle on Harden make this look like nothing but an accident.
Man if Giannis wins MVP after being shut down by Horford ..
"this is a good summary of all of it, point by point.

https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/vince-carters-most-disappointing-moments-to-publish-tuesday-morning/"
"Al Horford gets a mismatch. But Giannis is sagging off to help from the left. So Horford drives right, baseline and dunks it with Giannis getting there after the fact.


Al Horford is so fucking smart man"
"Refs been garbage though. Literally every call going the warriors way.

That and 1 that curry got."
Why does that matter if he's only trying to draw fouls? Why not kick his leg out?
D‚ÄôAntoni just said he was bleeding from the eye... seems pretty serious to me
The record is definitely higher than 9 lol
He has finals experience so Celtics in 4
honestly bud should just leave middleton in for the rest of the game and let him pull from three on every possession
Hi! Have you met our friend the Houston Rockets fans?
"Oh shit, here comes Austin Rivers, but unironically"
Thank god for the refs
"People said the same thing about Dirk playing in the same era as Kobe and Duncan, even some of those Melo Nugget lead teams where seen as bigger championship threats than Dirk was.

The Mavs weren‚Äôt even the best team in the west until they started rolling in the playoffs."
That's not a fucking foul. Stop bailing Giannis out
He shouldn‚Äôt have ever been an mvp in the first place
He didn‚Äôt rape anyone
FT differential is a terrible way to judge bias in referees
I'd wager that his supporters dont even watch the nba. We good.
R A P I S T
Marv on his Perd Hapley shit right now i like it
Not even slightly afraid ya cunt
He really struggles with this. Had basically the exact same post on here last offseason. I periodically just DM him supportive messages when I notice him looking a bit off. Who knows if he sees them or not but like to think he does
The shimmy lol the disrespect
*Oh fuck put it back in*
"He made at least 8 mistakes in the second half, and it's something I don't try to pay attention to."
draymond the nut kicking eye gouger
All those Knicks fans will become Brooklyn fans if they get KD. We support both teams in the city.
Thank god. He is the lesser of two evils compared to Austin Rivers.
"I‚Äôm no CP3 stan by any means but Steve Javie was always my least favorite ref in the league right up until the day he retired. He was basically Scott Foster before Scott Foster. Dude had an ego the size of Jupiter when he was reffing games and always seemed to think he was there to be the star of the show. And to me, it also seems a little unprofessional for even a former ref to throw players under the bus, considering they‚Äôre supposed to be objective.

TLDR fuck the refs and Steve Javie in particular"
I love how there's the conspiracy from some Celtics fans that the NBA wants them to lose this game so it's a longer series for money. Or that the MVP shouldn't be down 0-2. As a Sixers fan I know this pretty well - your team had a shit night and the Bucks had it going. Pack it up and move on. Accept the loss like big boys and dont blame the refs.
What about those 30 something games with Amare? I remember him balling out in the garden for a while. He had one game where he made the last shot but it was after the buzzer I believe. I think he scored like 30+ that game. I remember seeing the garden on tv and being kinda amazed at how loud it was.
I bet the concession stands in Milwaukee have great cheese items.
"I mean dude donated a huge portion of his salary to his community, just that‚Äôs enough to get my respect"
Honestly imagine Harden with an eye patch and that beard. He could truly be the villain we deserve.
Hope he‚Äôs ok. I really like Harrell. Guy is an absolute stud on the court. Pulling for him now.
Green should be ejected
As nasty as his eye
"Bleeding from the eye, jesus I hope everyone calling him a flopper or cheering feels like an ass."
It‚Äôs 1 loss...where‚Äôs Lebron these days anyway?
When you hit your first dab
China did well with one
yo why isn't Yao playing?
What was that defense by the warriors just now why did they not pressure rivers?
Lol even now I'm still amazed at some of the ridiculous anti Harden shit that gets upvoted on this sub
So we acting like every time he touches the paint it‚Äôs a foul to breathe on him? God this is terrible to watch
"""Gordon Hayward has looked like a different guy this past few weeks"" - Marv

I instantly imagined him picturing some other dude and mistaking him for Hayward. LMAO."
Did Marv call Brook Lopez Mirotic?
"Kanter seems like a nice enough guy, but everything's so damn dramatic with him"
"Just saw that. 

As somebody who has struggled with mental health for years, any sort of support is appreciated in dark times. Sent him some love on Insta. You folks should too. Hope he pulls through this.

If anybody out there is in a similar situation hit me up and lets talk."
Too late to pucker up now MDA
I don't think so either. Draymond apologized on Hardens way out
Houston fans are gonna be so fucking salty all night lol.
Wow Celtics shooters had an off night better give up the whole series and eat cake. Celtics are a better team and will win this series.
"I'd like an investigation into all major democratic candidates for sexually assaulting me.  I was deeply traumatized and don't remember any details, where, when, etc.  I haven't come forward sooner because the pain was too much, but I realize that I have to speak up so this doesn't continue.  Please respect my truth, because it took a lot of courage for me to speak it.  If you don't believe me then you don't believe any women, and you are therefore a misogynist.  Love wins."
"When you become notorious for dirty shit, of course the sub is going to hate him"
Did Boston promise to draft him or something? Or did brad Stevens fake recruit him at butler? What did you do to him!
Yea if you believe him
I truly believe this is the greatest meme this subreddit has produced. It's golden every time.
"Yeah I made it 2 shots into this video and it‚Äôs a bad take. Really SVP? James Harden has to jump higher when he‚Äôs shooting over someone than over no one? It‚Äôs not comparable. Laughable take honestly. You‚Äôre absolutely correct. But then what standard are we setting? That offensive fouls on 3PAs must be compared to that particular player‚Äôs normal shooting form? So players should make their normal shooting form a kick-out-three? Nah. The NBA needs to write a fucking rule, and call it consistently."
blatant foul on draymond
I can‚Äôt begin to explain how much I agree with this statement.
This thread is really pretty right now. Almost no Boston fans posting and if we can get a bunch of people with no connection to Boston to shut the fuck up then we all win.
Single digit lead after that ugly half is a blessing for Houston
Lmao he‚Äôs really getting every call. I mean he hasn‚Äôt made a shot all game
Harden down like he got shot.
If you're within 8 pts over or under for each player and correct in your prediction I'll buy you a 76ers jersey of your choice
I‚Äôm just here to make sure everybody overreacts and claims that Kyrie is the worst player of all time and that Brad Stevens could be outcoached by a Magic 8 Ball

"(James Harden bleeds from his eyes)


Y'all: If he dies, he dies


But on a basketball note, whoever wins this series is limping into round 3 right?"
Cheering injuries... real classy gsw fans
KD and warriors will get their rings but their legacy will always be that of some bitch ass cupcakes. Fuck the warriors
"We're not going to let you masturbate by bending over backwards to justify to yourself that trump isn't a sexist, racist, nationalist.  We're as clued into his dog whistles as you are.  Delude yourself all you want but we needn't help you.  Any asshole can think of dozens of nationally embarrassing moments of trump's blatant racism.  Asking us to list them would be an exercise in collective stupidity.  And if we correlate your support of a racist, with you supporting it as well than that's a part of your choice when you voice your support."
"Boston in MAX 5, Bucks are overhyped. Their star is one dimensional"
9 points on 18 shots i know russ is a bricklayer but he would be sentenced to death for that
"Agree 100%. The Warriors should be so easy to root against with the stacked team, but on the court they're all amazing players playing the game the right way. Harden ain't even trying to make shots anymore, he tries to draw fouls with weird motions and exaggerations and if the shot actually goes in it's a bonus."
This postseason has taught me that y‚Äôall only care if a kid has a shit game if it‚Äôs Ben Simmons
"Harden eye is fine, not even close to Lebrone one"
Man fuck everyone who cheered hardens injury
They have addressed it ! Trump and his supporters are the ones still stuck on stupid about the wall.
Hey asshole your the moron. Get fucked
I bet Charles has a wall or a gate around his house.
"Kyrieeeeee cook it Kyrie! Jayson Tatum rookie how I'm ballin in this league (Ohhhhh shit). (Caution danger, might break ya ankles). First round drafts picks throw em in the V. Sauce em up like Byrie!"
Have the rockets gotten a single call?
Curry gets more shots which is scary
"lmao, this dumbass doesnt realize you jump higher (and thus go farther forward) when youre trying to shoot OVER a defender. Fucking moron"
It's not on his shooting hand so he is good to go.
Refs bailing this bum out
bucks are so lucky rn
That's not what he means you dolt
"Because the Celtics defensive strategy is to have 2, sometimes 3/4 guys collapse on Giannis in the paint, pretty much conceding wide open 3s to us whenever we want.  It's not crazy for professional basketball players to shoot over 40% on wide open catch and shoot 3s.  We made some tough ones but also actually missed a ton of completely uncontested 3s."
People like who he is doing a good thing to speak on that subject! Why are people reacting negatively?
"I don't have an Instagram, what does it say?"
Oh shit I thought he had 3 the first game. This changes everything!!!!
You're losing the next 3
Absolutely no fight in the Rockets.
Nah hes just old carmelo
"Everything is political, be it sport or art. Deal with it."
Can‚Äôt wait for the overreactions for the Bucks. I‚Äôm still really nervous about this series.
Petition to change the sub name to r/reactionary
Trump reportedly added Barkley to the list of people he wants to eat fast food with at the White House this summer
Inject this into my veins.
"bucks in 6 

-B Jennings"
The fuck are these calls lol
"Imagine if rockets fans said half the shit y'all saying about harden, about Curry if he was still out"
"/r/nba is full of hot takes. Even if the Bucks end up winning up by 25, the series will be tied up going into Boston with a +3 point differential for the Bucks.   
  
That being said, fuck the Celtics."
"Wait, are you supposed to be sober at rec leagues?"
Still ain't coming off the bench.
He plays dirty and he‚Äôs always whined. The worst star in the league
but here you are!
Imagine not replicating your regular season win% in the postseason /s
Good things happen when Giannis gets ticky tack foul calls
"Wasn‚Äôt he president for the last deal that overwhelmingly benefited players who had been in the league as long as he had? I think he‚Äôll be successful after basketball, but I‚Äôm skeptical of his Union reputation."
"""FUCK!!"" - Stephen Curry"
Still better than Mark Jackson doing a Warriors game.
"This is the first year my five year old son has had any interest in the NBA, and we have been watching the playoffs together. I almost teared up when he pointed at the screen and asked, ""who is that guy daddy?"" with tremendous excitement. I smiled and said, ""that is Jayson Tatum, the next Jordan Clarkson."" I'm just glad he has someone so close in age to look up to."
This is some terrible basketball right now
"Yeah obviously he's faking. Draymond apologized because he's in on it. And Harden left the game because he wants to sell his flop.

All of this is more likely than you just being a fool."
he‚Äôs not injured you absolute goober
Has the greek bum ever been called for a travel before?
This is why children should have a set bedtime
If the series goes 7 we win i feel
Bucks are getting every call though
"s/o to you, i did not know that.. Wikipedia says he's propably 3 years older"
Because thats totally equivalent.
He also immediately apologized
"If your main focus is winning, I‚Äôd honestly say that those two things you said are the same thing. At least that‚Äôs how I see it is a competitor. It‚Äôs what happens when playing to win takes a back seat to playing for the love or spirit of the game."
That‚Äôs not true actually
Cp3 might kill this man on live television
All news sites are entertainment sites that‚Äôs how modern news works
"I don‚Äôt know if it just me but the Celtics just look way better. Like when the Bucks get even a little momentum, the Celtics just take it on the chin and hit back even harder"
The rig is on lmao
Paul is pretty fucking unlikeable. Even people who like him don't like him.
Golden State with all the flops in the first half
KD gonna tie LeBron's rings this year and Curry gonna pass him lmao GOAT my ass getting surpassed in your own era
"You could say the same thing with the ratio of any fanbase, it‚Äôs just the Lakers is more prominent cause of the bigger fanbase. 

You are correct, shame on the clippers for ONLY covering the Laker banners. If they wanted to have a more clipper atmosphere why don‚Äôt they cover all banners at staples? Kings, sparks, and even Taylor Swifts championship banners should be covered."
Eh they organize brigades on discord. Spez is just too big of a pussy to do anything about them
Bring back the Seattle SuperSonics.

The irony is everything people say about Harden can be applied to Giannis even more
"Single one that argues in good faith? I‚Äôm just curious how do those people argue In good faith you have ppl in this thread calling people that voted for trump bigots,racists,homophobes with no proof. This goes back to what I said earlier in this thread people just label because you don‚Äôt agree with them why be adults and discuss things when I can just call you a Nazi or a Communist."
"And you feel guilty, because you think that you shouldn't feel depressed or anxious because you have money/possessions/whatever"
"Getting dicked on defense, stagnant on offense and the refs aren‚Äôt giving us any favors"
Tbf it was really bad. Like it seemed like there were several bots that would automatically post any tweet by any of the main reporters. The constant spam got annoying.
Why? People should be able to talk to people with opposing viewpoints
FK THAT LEPRECHAUN LOOKING ASS AND FK THE CELTICS TOO
"I don‚Äôt know, it kinda seems to me like I was actually bashing his overly sensitive ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù"
the 3 idiots that did that in a thread of thousands?
he doesn't come close to cash considerations though
Yeah he can. I sent him a Dm too
I'm glad Harden is ok.
"Lol I think you meant pedantic, not semantic. You were being pedantic about semantics"
They were carrots. C Web was gobblin them shits up
Anyone wanna enlighten me to what happened to the boy who cried wolf?
Curry will def come back. I think Kobe once played with 7-8 jammed fingers. Dislocated fingers don't effect a player's stroke as much as people think.
He also poked Lebron in last year.
"Those Portland Clyde teams.... man... if only Sabonis had come over when he was drafted. 

But those Portland teams were so deep.  Drexler and Terry (and Drazen in 1991 and Ainge in 1992) in the back court, and then Buck Williams, Jerome Kersey, Cliff Robinson. And some great role players like Mark Bryant and Danny Young.  

A couple of bounces going the other way, and they might have beat the Lakers in 1991 as well... could have had three straight trips to the finals."
"Milwaukee crowd can shut up, these are all make up calls from Giannis' Free Throwapalooza in the 1st"
Yep. It‚Äôs the biggest concern I have with his game.
"Al ""Lockdown defender"" Horford just gets away with a lot of fouls and I have yet to see him in legal guarding position on drives change my mind"
Curry fouls again. You do the same to him and he gets the foul. Can someone body Curry and smack hard as fuck on the screen!
I look up at my TV and it's just Giannis shooting fucking free throws lol
65% from 3 in his playoff career against the celtics yes
"Yeah I mean, he's probably right about Chris Paul, but he's also a shitty ref."
Did they cheer before or after they saw any kind of replay? If before then they have no idea how serious it could be.
Enjoy your delusional echo chamber
Trump is an anti-vaxxer
Yea but it's all scripted man
"Khris ""My name is literally James"" Middleton"
LMAO CELTICS WHAT HAPPENED
Boston fucked first then we worry about league
3 ugly &amp; rushed 3's in a row. That's not our game.
"He is a bitch

Thanks for playing!"
"I can relate, I honestly feel like that about Harden. He seems like a pretty cool dude, and I respect the hell out of his work ethic and the strides he makes to improve his game every year. But man complaining and over-reacting to sell everything on the court is annoying."
Because he‚Äôs just as shit as the other refs.
That was a horrible call.  Hill got away with murder.
"Walls work at dramatically reducing illegal immigration though. Look at any of the many 20th/21st century examples: Hungary, Israel, East Germany, etc"
Similar to coming off the bench for the bulls id imagine
You could write an entire essay on how the Warrior's used the salary cap jump and injury issues to lead to where they are right now lol.
Hey now. I like Kornheiser.
Let's be real. They'd send Harden out there headless.
Feels like it can easily make things worse.
"Demarcus cousins, draymond green, and Chris Paul are the top 3 whiners in the NBA."
Giannis' constant whining is unbecoming.
Man hates us I swear
"Dammit I took the over on the o/u Giannis scores 29.5 points but it had to be a blow out

Still happy though. Say it with me: FUCK THE CELTICS"
Awhhh harden is like a baby who wants attention so he feigns pain
Smh and y‚Äôall called this a flop
Unfortunately... if it started at 8:30 the west coast fans (who are the real fans of these teams) May miss some of the game because of work...
I can't believe Pat Connaughton is playing this many minutes for a fake 1 seed.
this game will determine if harden's beard has the ability of sight
"Kyrie is getting murdered when he drives.

Giannis ELBOWS Baynes in the face, gets the call."
Green got him in the eye going for the rebound. Accidental
"What bias here? CP3 has quite a long reputation of doing dirty shit and whining to refs, it's not like people think that right this second and never before"
Curry low key hackin like a mf....it‚Äôs the playoff tho I guess
"Bruh he got poked in the fucking eye. I dont like harden either but come on, quit the bullshit."
This thread went from Celtics in 4 to bucks in 5 real quick lol.
"I think livingston's almost done, seems like his legs aren't the same on his jumpers no more cause that shot used to be money."
Honestly. Hes getting absolutely neutralized
I've had a scratch on my cornea before. Shit felt like allergies X10 that never went away no matter what. Was the most irritating constantly aggravating thing ever.
"But he gave Montrezl Harrell a hug and paid respect to em after the Clippers series, he‚Äôs a good guy now according to r/NBA"
If you support Trump and say it on reddit 95% of the Subreddits will hate/dislike you for it and downvote. Its wild.
"Milwaukee about to get exposed this series. Sweep action, fake MVP"
The amount of reactionary post you see on this sub smh
"The point isn't that BR reported on what somebody said, but that it's harder to trust the legitimacy of what they report."
"""They haven't won a playoff series after losing the first two games since 1995 against the Phoenix Suns. ""

Pertinent info"
Just cause they‚Äôre saying negative things about the rockets? Or because you‚Äôre genuinely tired of seeing them?
This is why I read postgame threads.
"Playing pick up ball against someone with long nails is the worst. 

They always seem to reach the most too"
How could Scott Foster do this
Horford just hangs on Giannis arms/back all game. It's hilarious
"Next week:

Enes Kanter has been traded to the Guangdong Southern Tigers"
"Raps fans get so fucking salty about the refs. 

I swear to god they have the biggest persecution complex of any fanbase."
"OP, the full quote sounds far too rational, do you think you could cherry pick and piece together a line or two to make it spicier, front page, hot take material?"
Alright I'm not crazy that's what I saw too but I wasn't sure he spoke French. Fais attention definitely .
No ass whoopin today
Rockets have 13 turnover but ‚ÄúrEfS aRE bAD tHeY WOn gaMe‚Äù
the way boston fans are complaining about the refs you'd think the refs were trying to desegregate school busing
"Every other comment here is either ""fuck Draymond"" or ""fuck flopping ass harden ""

You know sometimes shit is unintentional and getting poked in the eye sucks right?"
I see you're a gigantic romantic for semantics as well. Disregard my frantic pedantic antics.
"I dont think he's posting to inform, but to rile people up. Im tired of seeing people bitch about the refs."
top 1 player all time honestly
Lol at all the people saying middleton was the worst all star they've ever seen
"Straight from the article:  
In December 2015, Trump [called for](http://time.com/4139476/donald-trump-shutdown-muslim-immigration/) a ‚Äúa total and **complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States**,‚Äù including refusing to readmit Muslim-American citizens who were outside of the country at the time.  
In June 2017, Trump said 15,000 recent **immigrants from Haiti ‚Äúall have AIDS‚Äù** and that 40,000 Nigerians, once seeing the United States, would never ‚Äú[go back to their huts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html)‚Äù in Africa.

At the White House on Jan. 11, Trump [vulgarly called for](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_trumpmeeting-445pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.e55b028dcfb0) **less immigration from Haiti** and Africa and more from Norway."
That‚Äôs enough for us to determine that James Harden is playing bad
He is bad all the time he just hides it by being really fucking good
Don't kid yourselves Rockets fans. You'd still lose even with Harden.
I love this rivalry.
Now they‚Äôre telling me the Bucks have lost home court advantage
HERE COMES AUSTIN RIVERS!
"he still gets an absurd amount of FTA, people are just too focused on hating James Hitler and Chris Paulocaust"
He should patch his eye up like a pirate
Iman Shumpert been doing construction for an eternity now. I'm having fucking nam flashbacks
How do they call Steph on that when Harden literally pushed off 3 times?
Plot twist - the same guy got both tattoos
He also did this to Lebron last year lol
He was trying to play that off like he said nothing bad üòÇüòÇ
"If anybody ever needs to know why rockets fans have a victim complex, look at this fucking game thread"
Clean as fuck. Dude really gets every call
This game is going to be lit
"Better, guy is a straight boogie man against us"
"I noticed that he wasn‚Äôt forcing it into the paint as much this game. Last game he‚Äôd drive and end up turning it over, but it seems he‚Äôs been more patient and isn‚Äôt afraid to back out and reset."
Raptors and 76ers fans are sooo cute right now. Such a loser mentality celebrating the Celtics losing like it‚Äôs a win for one of your teams lmao. I‚Äôm surprised the raptors don‚Äôt hang banners for winning playoff series.
"His career playoff averages are 24/5/3 on 57% TS, he‚Äôs obviously a great player, but the myth that he‚Äôs this top 5 player suddenly once he gets to the playoffs is ridiculous"
Imagine Rocket fans it Harden was shoulder checked like that.
This man is a walking meme - he has become self aware.
they were booing when he initially went down you right about that
I‚Äôm sorry but the ref excuse doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre down 25+ lmao
"Maybe they‚Äôre born with it. 


Maybe it's Maybelline."
Ce;ltics have made some VERY tough shots. Gap should have been wider so far
Eye is part of the ball
Celtics defense fucks so hard
Next time we'll try the opposite strategy
"My absolute, #1 least favorite player to watch in the NBA. Embiid is up there as well but Harden easily takes the top spot. I only watch a few games of his each year but when a player's goal is ALWAYS to get to the free throw line by putting up a shot that looks vaguely similar to Will Smith's spin, behind the back, over the shoulder toss from the Fresh Prince intro, I cannot respect that player."
"I thought OP was trolling but he really deleted everything. Shit, this is crazy. Hope everything is well with him."
Just because he's willing to get his hands dirty for his own sake doesn't mean he'll do it for others. Sports mentality and business mentality don't mix often anyway.
Bruh you're lucky. You could've been nick furyd my dude
in the 54th minute he had 19 turnovers also
"Bucks: 10 more 3pt attempts, 6 fewer points in the paint = more free throw attempts than Celtics"
I wish I got paid to run 50m down the court and fall on the ground to get a free foul call
I hate eye injuries
When your friend says it‚Äôs your turn to hit the blunt but you‚Äôre about to die
You mean the same thing they should have learned from the day they started watching the NBA. The overreactions and hot takes after an unexpected game 1 win are always hilarious.
Refs plus eye pokes = win
"our offense DIES in games sometimes, only makes it worse that we shoot a lot of threes and barely any free throws. i really wish we got to the line more."
They are killing us from 3 tonight.
"People like scoring, people don't like breaks. 

Free throws actually create issues for the business. It isn't like a proper break in play where you can run an advert, they're boring and tedious from a spectator perspective, they extend the game, they also destroy any flow in the game.

Time outs work well because quite often they either come at the end of the run so it's either 'fuck yeah, waste a time-out because we're killing you' or 'holy shit, thank Christ now let's see if we can gather our composure and make a comeback'. So there's some element of suspense during. Even at the end of games it's often to draw up a play.

The NBA want the game to be free-flowing, high scoring and as many dunks and threes as possible. They don't want someone shooting 20+ FTs a night unless they can work out a way to better monetise them."
Yeah that‚Äôs a cursed image
"To be fair, unless a top 2 pick ends up on the table he‚Äôs still by far the most valuable piece being discussed right now."
Look how disorganized Celtics look from 1 PNR with GIannis
That's a broken finger. Curry's done. The Warriors are done. Who do you guys think will win it all now?
I‚Äôm shocked Tatum hasn‚Äôt gotten more shit so far. He‚Äôs been absolute garbage.
Fuck all of yall shitting on the eye injury.
Middleton in the playoffs vs Boston is legitimately as good as Curry though and that's not really a hot take.
"Harden's eyes do not look that fucking bad, give me a break."
They also buttfucked little boys and kept slaves.
This is the Celtics I remember from regular season.
"summary: vince signed a (2?  3?  year) extension with the raps with the promise the management at the time was going to build a competitive team around him, but they had other ideas once glen grunwald got fired.  rob babcock, the interim GM, was tasked with trading him.  vince started acting out - saying stuff like ""I'll never dunk again"", stopped giving any semblance of an effort that should be expected of a pro athlete, etc.  eventually babcock traded him to the nets for peanuts.

fans i think have largely moved on given he got that nice ovation a couple of years ago as a member of the grizzlies, but he's never publically apologized for what went down in that last year in toronto."
That extra long pinky nail.
"*The hottest player in these playoffs is Kevin Durant*

Reggie outted"
And seven turnovers and 5 flex and yell celebrations
people legit happy harden is hurt. yall are disgusting
"Lost in all this is the fact the refs has 0 impact that quarter

It was nice to see some back and forth basketball for once"
"Flopping isn't even the main problem. It's jumping into people, hooking their arms, or kicking out his leg to manufacture contact."
"Rockets had a terrible half and are only down 9. Double digit turnovers, Harden injury, House's minutes. They can still steal this one."
Oh poor baby Giannis didn‚Äôt get bailed out again
"Serious question: how many times have the Warriors players injured/harmed the other team's key player in a playoff series? (I'm not saying they \*intentionally\* did it - other than the Kawhi injury - but just curious)

\- Kyrie (Klay incidental knee contact)

\- LeBron (Eye pokes)

\- Kawhi (stepping under his shot)

\- Harden (eye poke)

\- Steven Adam's (his horse sized testicles took a beating by Draymond)

\- Aldridge? (I vaguely remember something with players getting under him... or was hestepping under Durant?)"
this sounds like a Chris Smoove video
And then when Mirotic shot he called him Lopez
"I've watched that ""final 4 minutes of Game 7"" video the NBA released at least 10 times. Always puts me in a better mood."
Can you guys believe the amount of trash talking Draymond does? He's lucky I'm not on the court. I have a zero-tolerance policy for trash talkers.
Hayward actually does. He's just not a high usage player for us so the raw numbers aren't great.
Don‚Äôt kick them while they‚Äôre down
Get up of the ground man.. you barely got touched. That's just embarrassing for the rockets
Draymond is a cheater and the refs hate Harden. Pretty simple
Lmao im Mexican bruh
"In b4 the ""reFS hANdeD hIM tHe wiN"""
yeah this didn't seem noteworthy at all
"C‚Äôs  looking like the pacers in the third quarter feels good

Edit: Boston fans plz don‚Äôt downvote it‚Äôs a joke it‚Äôs hard for me to route against brad, and Hayward"
Could you imagine being his friend in real life and trying to have conversations with him?
Kyrie's leadership is blaming others for his bad passes LOL
#THE REFS CAUSED THE ROCKETS TO TURN THE BALL OVER 9 TIMES IN THE QUARTER.
I would be kicked out of the NBA so fucking fast if I were in their position. I would not be able to keep my cool and swing at a ref within half a fucking season haha I get how hard the refs job is but I could just not keep my cool.
"I mean, he's done it before."
A steady 3 point shooter particularly from 3. That dude senile. Ian eagle deserves that job right now
More valuable than ball + Ingram + kuzma? Lol
"Is it just me, or did this game start exceptionally early/on time?"
They had their best season in franchise history last year.
"Can we just have Kevin Harlan call all the games?

I don't fucking care how we do it: clone him, hire Kevin Harlan impersonators, splice together Kevin Harlan voice clips on a computer, breach the time-space continuum to grab multiple Kevin Harlans from various timelines/universes.

I just want him to call the playoff games. Marv needs to go."
Enes probably tells every girl he loves them
"The analogy is this: The teacher (Scott Foster) is good at her job based on the criteria the school (NBA) set for her. Her students pass their tests (when they review his calls they pass the standards for accuracy), she keeps the students behavior in check (he keeps the player's behavior in check), and she has tenure (he has tenure). It's not part of her (his) job to make her students (players and fans) think she's nice."
Not in a 4 game sweep
"He shot 61% from 3 against Boston in the 7-game series last season, and is currently shooting 71% from 3 so far this year (10/14 across 2 games)."
Might wanna take another stab at that
If you think Durant isn‚Äôt the best Warrior or even the best player in the world you haven‚Äôt been watching this series.
"Im not defending Harden or saying SC did this, but couldn't you just cherry pick shots to fit the narrative your trying to push? He took a fuckload of threes during the season, there are probably instances of him landing all manner of directions. I think it better proves intent if you show me the two happening repeatedly in the same game."
You‚Äôre childish if you think he flopped on that
People talked about Horford like he was a god after game 1. If you‚Äôve never watched the playoffs before he‚Äôs the most inconsistent player
He says this about every team he‚Äôs on
Said something like the only walls are the ones that are forming in his arteries and called him a fat fuck
Barely but you get used to it. Still better than being a Knicks or Washington fan.
UNDERDOG PUT THAT ON A T-SHIRT
He does rival Blake Griffin for the 2nd worst footwork in the league
An inconspicuous brown spot on his shorts as well
"That‚Äôs why Draymond lost all that weight, so his spindly little fingers would more easily fit in people‚Äôs eye sockets!"
"thats it nephew, give me your keyboard"
His finger looked a bit messed up. Ah shit.
Go back and watch Kyrie's highlights in the Finals vs the warriors.  Pretty much everything he did was going 1v1 and cooking Klay and co.  Lebron doesn't have that much to do with Kyrie's INDIVIDUAL play that he showcased in the Finals.  It's not like Lebron was setting him up over and over.
WTF is wrong with you?
What is the hive?
Sounds like you don't understand much of anything if it's not spoon-fed to you in a special interest Facebook post
"‚ÄúDamn harden with the flop of the year. Been in the locker room for 6+ minutes...embellish much‚Äù

-average rNBA user"
"""By my calculations thats a worth of 69 points and one Draymond suspension"" -  Daryl Morey"
"Yeah, I feel like because Harden causes so much controversy among fans, people think CP3 is just getting thrown in with it.

CP3 has always been honestly at least moderately dirty and he's always been a huge whiner"
milwaukee fans better not piss of the refs they're the reason they're in the game
"The skirt thing is kinda funny, to each his own I guess. The assault is just nasty though."
"You realize that the money we've invested in border control over the last 15 years has been effective right? Nine years ago we passed a point where visa over-stayers passed the amount of border-crossers we get per year. Yet your plan is to invest 80 billion dollars of tax money to make a wall. If you want to take that much money from our country, it has to go to something that will be useful. A wall that can be beat with a ladder won't do a single thing.

We need to bring the amount of visa-overstayers back down under border-crossers before we even think about investing 80 billion dollars into border control."
Can‚Äôt play Boston in Finals
Love it but Chuck in a Celtics jersey just feels...wrong.
"Yep, I especially liked that one play where he passed to Ersan for the mid ranger when they doubled him on his drive. He is improving but still not his normal self yet in my opinion."
"He said it in a podcast: 

cavsnation.com/kyrie-irving-says-2015-knee-fracture-klay-caused-childhood-injury/amp/"
yup that was r/nba last 2 days
Stone Cold Steve Austin Rivers
The raptors went for a high five and Vince left them hanging. It was super awkward for everyone involved and they really just want to move past it.
"1-1 baby, the travelling Giannis magic elbow push off show is going to Boston for game 3!  With the ref brigade!"
Father Time playing D on iggy every game
"if you look at his hands in interviews even now, it‚Äôs clear he did permanent damage lol"
"Rivers tried to get up but he flopped back down again, Jerebko tried to help him up with a little kick lol"
"No doubt. Lots of respect for him, would love to have him as an announcer one day (even though I know he does Nets and cavs? games right now)."
Yeah let's attack the guy who got slapped in the face. You can do literally anything to Harden and this sub will cheer if it's not called a foul.
&gt; I was breaking...him ... I was just... best... I also said he was ... ass...
"Almost sounded like he said ""think I broke it..."""
They would sweat that shit off in about 30 seconds
"Hey guys, just wanted to say, these are great takes."
Great example of a wall not working.
I like this mostly because his single game +/- swung by 34 points even though he was shit in both games. Should tell you everything you need to know about that stat.
"Probably not, unless TBD is going to be KD."
well at least now curry fangirls have an excuse for when he's struggling.
"Dude it literally came out they are targeting Stephs ankles, how are you ok with this"
"I still don't get this sentiment. If walls ""don't work"" or are even ""immoral"" shouldn't we be demolishing what we currently have? 

I'm not a Trump supporter and don't even have a strong desire for more ""wall"" to be added, but it just seems like rhetoric to hate Trump on, rather than actually addressing the matter or any principled stance."
"build a firewall too, duh"
Wait wtf. Did this game start on time?
"Beadle will then proceed to roast him, and Jalen willingly joins in."
"Oh man, it's so bad you've gone delusional"
Man people really be thinking these game threads are solely for trashing certain players/teams
How tf did Milwaukee win 60+ games ?
Because I do watch the pistons‚òπ
"Gonna need a ""FUCK THE ROCKETS"" flair, too. 

All other flairs can be retired."
"""The apple sure fell far from the tree. You must have lived on the side of a hill.""

Never heard that one before lol"
Shoots like Khris big like Middleton
"Tale the loss gracefully. Even though you are saying it didn't effect the final score, just by mentioning it you are trying to lower what the Bucks did. Take the loss with some class."
Harden really investing in this flop
"""Wait, now they're saying it was Bed, Bath and Biyombo"""
"I hope none of you Warrior fans are under the collective delusion that your precious team was built by merit. You may not notice, but history will, that the only thing separating the 2014-2019 Golden State Warriors from every other team is that they just so happened to have been the most talented team the exact year the salary cap jumped by 30%."
2009 Lebron could never have done what 2016 Lebron did
Giannis is the James Harden of big men
Can I pay for more tho?
"Wait, his feet went forward, why'd he even try to shoot it at that point, he was just throwing his feet forward fishing for a foul"
There is a difference making an observation or have a take to calling Giannis useless and people uprove it .
"Literally zero skill involved 

Just bulls his way in and gets free throws no matter what"
Aw man the guy roots for his team I guess he‚Äôs irrational /s. You‚Äôre being a goober
"To be fair, I believe that his foot was on the foul line right at the elbow when he took the shot."
Who here has said he‚Äôs a very intelligent person... link ??? Or is this just a circlejerk comment
Warriors are amazing to watch. If only their fans weren‚Äôt so insufferable.
Looked like a dislocated finger
Khris ‚ÄúSteph ‚Äò*Seth Curry*‚ÄôCurry‚Äù Middleton
"‚ÄúTough call right there‚Äù

Just say it was a horse shit call"
Might have to look into this....
"Immigrants aren't the enemy, the bourgeoisie and their running dogs are"
"I understand that the league needs a California team to carry tv ratings, but at least try to make it seem like the fix isn't in."
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have Dolan‚Äù will be the first slide on the presentation
Celtics are gonna get their bitch asses beat by 40 lmao Bucks are gonna sweep the next 3 after this
I wish somebody would tell those Rockets players to fucking box out and not just fucking stand there and watch the ball.
THIS THREAD IS ABOUT TO GET SALTY
personally I would like it better if it was a higher number
GSW should be worried if KD leaves this summer.
Man you can't leave Middleton for Bledsoe. Let Bledsoe take that shot all day Middleton is too hot rn
"Kobe's bad ass-ness is way overrated to me, and that's saying something considering he is a bad ass lol. It makes me think the people who post about it have the pain tolerance of a baby."
His transformation into Queen Latifah is almost complete.
it's absolutely hilarious to me that bucks fans complain about the way giannis is officiated
what in the world?
Chuck doesn't care about poor Americans that can't get entry level jobs because they don't know a foreign language.
Someone get him a pirate patch and a gold tooth
"If the Rockets win, ya'll need to put some respect on Austin Rivers for holding it down when Harden was out. Nothing short of a statue outside the arena for sure"
The bucks can‚Äôt rely on shooting 50% from 3 to get such a big lead. Non calls in the third for the Celtics while calling fouls on clean blocks/sending the Bucks to the line on that run ended the game. Kyrie played horrible but the refs were completely one way that third quarter and it completely shifted the game. Free throw numbers being close at the end doesn‚Äôt matter when we shot 11 in the last 6 minutes. Hope Kyrie and Gordon play better on Friday.
"Bleeding from the eye

&amp;#x200B;

r/nba  Lol pussy just get up bro it's not that bad"
"I mean shitting his pants in the middle of the game instead of going to the toilet is out of this world efficiency, 6900 IQ play right there."
Because if you still like trump you are either braindead or a racist.
Remember Celtic fans said game 4 ? Pepperidge farm remembers! Stay woke celtics
"""not blinking"". I see what you did there, Harlan."
Austin Rivers v. Jonas Jerebko - the Western Conference playoff battle we've been dying to see.
Well fuck this game. Curry is in the locker room and harden is down. Absolutely not what any and all of us wanted.
Found the open borders guy
His defense has been really good
That‚Äôs why rondo two pieced his ass
"Are you kidding me Ersan, why are you taking a charge in garbage time?"
"Sure, you can expect that there‚Äôll be toxic Laker fans. We have the biggest fan base out of them all, but most of the fanbase isn‚Äôt. But imagine the tables being turned and the Lakers somehow covered up division titles or banners that clippers would put up for making the playoffs at Staples? Now that would be insecure."
Trump: The day I take defensive tips from Chuck is the day liberals stop being anti-vaxxers
"Ah yes, /s because you've seen how supportive the WNBA threads get.

Edit: Unsurprisingly, fucking case in point in the replies. This shit pretty much writes itself."
derrick rose had the same problem
"Too bad he stinks and is a playoff choker, Skip Bayless said it himself"
Goddamn I could listen to Richard Jefferson talk for hours
"Just the racist ones. 

That‚Äôs only like 98% of them"
"Mid range jumpers are the most inefficient shot in basketball. If you step back it's worth more points, if you scoot up it's a layup. KD notwithstanding"
Losing Game 1 is the secret ingredient. Philly vs Milwaukee ECF confirmed.
Celtics fans now resorting to bashing Bucks fans for being excited about winning. Nice
That‚Äôs his #1 move.
"While we're on the subject of toxicity, I'm team fuck Golden State."
draymonds finger sure loves the eyes of the opposing superstar. lebron last year harden this year
No the Trailblazers problem is that they have nobody to stop Jokic.
Giannis style of play even more annoying than James Harden
love how no one replies
If only Khris had some name that rhymed with scary or something. This dude deserves that (though Terry does seem to elevate his play a bit in the playoffs)
"Something about Draymond doing too much but is blown off by saying, ""he plays with passion..."""
Their team last year was at least on the same level as those championship teams.
that is indeed what I just said
Bhahahaha nice 2nd level flop Rozier.
Fuck Draymond an these refs
We're not winning shit playing this limp-dicked basketball we are now.  Jesus.
"""Welcome to the family"""
Well it‚Äôs time to slander the Celtics üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
"Interesting, he did not land 2 feet forward after his shot like Harden. ü§î"
I cringe every time they show it on TV. looks so painful
There‚Äôs no single case to be made for Larry bird over lebron. Zero
That was a nasty move by harden on iggy
"The fuck are u saying?


What is this, a comment for ants?"
Shhh Its 6am and im tryna watch the game quietly
The refs aren‚Äôt the reason we‚Äôre down (missed shots and turnovers) but they do change up the flow of the game easily. The moment tick tacky fouls are called on one end and not on the other leads to inconsistency on the defensive and offensive end. It‚Äôs so simple for anyone who actually plays basketball.
All the nephews come out to play after each game. You don‚Äôt know what each thread will consist of until you open up the thread.
"Michael Jordan was right, Republicans buy Nike Shoes too. or something like that. I woudn't be surprised if many of the players, coaches, front office people in the NBA are conservative but stay quiet because of the possible backlash on social media."
"I expect Boston to bounce back, TD Garden is no joke. Crowd is insane and they feed off them"
"It's easy, Middleton just has to go 7-10 from 3 every night and hold Kyrie to single digit scoring and this series is over and done with üòè"
That replay looked like he was barely grazed
"I hope everyone notices the absolutely fucking ridiculous calls that Giannis gets. Baynes has his hands straight up, feet set, foul called cause Antetrevelko runs into him"
The Celtics got away from LeBron in the playoffs and now they have to play Middelton every playoffs now. Tough luck
It‚Äôs easy to talk yourself into someone having a chance to beat the Warriors until you actually watch the Warriors play. This is honestly beautiful basketball.
They told me Celtics in 4
Dude look what happened to Kermit Washington.  If they allowed fighting someone would get killed.
Thank you omg. The amount of times I've seen people compare immigration to a home intrusion without a hint of irony is insane.
Brandon Ingram ranks 11th btw.
KD is allergic to actual adversity. It'll be too funny when he leaves and gets exposed next year
"I swear we did something similar one year in playoffs, because I remember watching and laughing at all the the foul draw attempts against people who have their hands back like that neil degrasse meme"
"Pack it up on this one, Bucks shooting out of their minds, we can't hit anything open, and refs have instructions signed in blood to put Giannis to the line even if he knifes his defender. Take it back to Boston and take care of business."
dude stfu cp3 is not going to attempt to injure someone. don't just throw out wild shit like that without evidence
Bucks just needed some time to readjust to high level basketball. They had to dink around with the Pistons the first 4 games
They were both clocked by Lakers
Not as good as vs OKC Wiggins
"You better not OP, you better not start this shit."
So the Suns if they sign D'Lo and draft Zion?
U lost home court already lol
Just move to the mountain time zone. All games start and end at a reasonable hour.
"Here's some actual basketball knowledge for the ignorant fans who just wanna take cheap shots at each other.

The adjustment to put Hill on Kyrie and Bledsoe on Brown. Was key. Means Mirotic guards Morris. Much better match ups all around.

That was a great move by Bud.

See you idiots on Friday."
There was also a play where Horford slaps Giannis‚Äô wrist/forearm causing a turnover. That didn‚Äôt seem to stop the basketball team from being motivated to play basketball.
"Averaging 34/9/9 across something like 22 postseason games, the most 40-point games in a single postseason run, the 51/8/8 game... one of the craziest playoff performances I‚Äôve ever seen."
&gt; Come here little boy
How flukey of a game do the bucks need to win
This fucking guy. Chuck 2020.
Lol how do Wolves fans survive this place
"I think the Mods are asleep at the wheel. It's pure anarchy in r/nba, r/nfl you got a pulse?"
Helps when there are no double teams. Now teams can key on him
It's one of the languages in Cameroon
This guy was bragging every week about how he was saving 10 dollars on taxes a week because trump is saving the middle class. Didn't say anything when he got 500 dollars less back on his tax refund.
Getting rid of these people helps humanity.
"2 straight blowouts in this series

definitely predicted this"
"r/nba: what a flopper. Get up you pussy

*Out comes the stretcher*

r/nba: This is just an elaborate way to get calls"
"As a somewhat bystander, when r/nba rains on a team goddamn it pours on them.

Celtic will be fine."
Refs literally  keeping the celtics in this game
"No, he's not.

Is Kyrie part of the Celtics young core?"
lmao he's a good player but Steph is no Middleton
"Real analysis and news driving the views, amirite. Instead of clickbait hot-takes. Same goes for this country, even the fuckin presidency and politics is a clickbaity joke"
"Could someone please help me find the link? I would be so gosh darn thankful if you could.  Not only was it a clear offensive foul, but this guy couldn't even move al hordord an inch. Embarrassing on two fronts, for the refs and for giannis. Again, and I can't stress this enough, could someone please do me a favor, and I thank you guys in advance. Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please."
"Celtics fans at the end of the first quarter

&gt; We‚Äôre on pace for 120 again against ‚Äúbest defense in the NBA‚Äù lmaoooo"
Mamba mentality. The numbers mean nothing.
I‚Äôm just here so I don‚Äôt get fined.
taught psych. okay the major risk factor isn't necessarily depression itself but HOPELESSNESS. if he or someone else you love is struggling then give them hope.
That's enough from you fabosexy
"bruh, i think your prioritities are not right"
Durant is so god damn good
They‚Äôre being outplayed in every quarter this series so far. This I wasn‚Äôt expecting. It doesn‚Äôt look the same team we‚Äôve seen since October.
I hope that's a promise. I want that flair.
"Shots at windy... 

:)"
"yeah give gobert a few more years, hes gonna get mvp votes for sure

someone might sneak him in a 5th place vote this year tbh

it matters more about the jazz team, and my comment is really more a nod to the jazz team ascending. if the jazz taem wins 60 games next year, gobert will definitely get a bundle of votes"
"Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero."
"Marv keeps calling Lopez Mirotic, time to hang it up old man"
Imagine complaining about the refs endlessly while down almost 30
And his reward is them to look the other way as he gets undercut on 3pt attempts.
Do the Knicks know?
"Players were all over the court as well, Boston had horrible spacing. 

Also guys trying to iso down Giannis for long two's? Shot selection was extremely suspect too."
I‚Äôd rather this series be decided by the refs than injuries
they still got conquered by the mongols
LeBron letting the east get to the finals
This is basically the worst series ever
"That's good for Marv lmao. Not exactly a mistake, just redundant"
Damn this man is so committed to the flop that he went into the locker room and stabbed his eyes with a needle /s
It was also superfolous
"Look at his glasses, he's obv smart"
Too many 7‚Äô white guys shooting 3s for Marv to keep track of
Lol Draymond hasn't made a 3 in 6 games then that one doesn't count
Really shows the difference between a player with pure skill and a player on a better coached team.
Kyrie saw Giannis's G1 and raised.  Bold strategy.
If you don't want to see a Chuck vs Trump fight then I don't want to be your friend.
KD: ‚ÄúI was having a hard time making a decision and my dear friend James reminded me what he does in difficult situations. Put one foot in front of the other. That‚Äôs I knew Houston was the perfect place for me.‚Äù
Same with the game 5 highlights where LeBron and Kyrie both drop 41 at oracle. The progression in the highlights where the fans are booing LeBron every time he touches the ball and he just hits every single shot then eventually they shut up after they realize he‚Äôs shitting on them.
I‚Äôd eat burgers with him anytime
"it‚Äôs actually the opposite. You get the force of ur shot from ur legs, bigger stronger dudes have to exert less to shoot the ball, so they jump less. Watch horford or Brook Lopez shoot a 3 they don‚Äôt even jump at all basically"
"I know Bucks history posts have been done to death but their history is ridiculous. They were nearly always competitive throughout the 70s and 80s, didn't do much at all in the 90s, had one good year in 2000-01, and now I dare say they are back. This is easily the best Bucks team since 2000-01 and arguably the best since KAJ was a Buck"
"Alright fellas I‚Äôm out, gotta study and rest up for my first final tomorrow morning"
This boutta be the most toxic /r/NBA game thread of all time
Please continue to guard Horford with Lopez
Lmao imagine the Boston crowd if Giannis gets away with all those travels next game
I‚Äôm a Rockets fan and I don‚Äôt think that. Every team has floppers or people bitching about the refs (including the Rockets of course) and I really just wish they would all shut the fuck up.
"scott frost should have been disbarred for letting harden get hit like that

edit: oh i know what i said. i meant it as satire. but ill stand by it. i thought it was funny, but i get why it sucked"
i love him now
Wall just got 10 feet taller
Vince wrote a bad review for Drake's latest album on Pitchfork
"Celtics have gotten burned by other teams opposing shooting guards all season long. Ross, Lavine, Murray, Hield, Beal, DLo, Caldwell Pope, Lou Will, Trey Bruke(Knicks iverson) , all guards on the spurs, and I'm missing a player whose not a well known name. 

This happening all season the celtics getting burned from sgs. It's like our weakness. They always go off"
Uhm next level flop by 77
warriors fans always come into threads acting like their the strongest dudes in the room
A wall around your fridge would have worked Charles.
Time is a flat circle.
"Good teammate but shoves J Lin out of NY? If he was a good teammate, he would still be on a team for vet leadership."
weird how a dozen plus downvoters in here
"I don‚Äôt live in Miami, people move. Happy cake day"
You never know if Andrew will go 0/13 or 8/20. This man is impossible to guard.
Peak /r/nba was the thread where Dwight Howard was accused of sexually assaulting some gay dude and people just decided it was true immediately and mods supported it.
"especially before the game. We don't have anything new to be angry about, so lets be angry at what can happen later.. Just trying to get people riled up"
Why can't people just give a straight answer. The guy is trying to learn.
"""Brook Lopez a steady 3 point shooter, especially from 3""

Just retire Marv"
And those people should also be ignored.
Hope people talk shit like when they were kissing his ass when he was doing good
"Yep it's worse and less entertaining. I've had to deal with Tom Brady existing the last 20 years, y'all can suffer through one more championship with Steph and KD playing side by side."
"Down? We got the split and the series is headed back to Boston lol. Celtics in 6. If you think Kyrie is going to shoot 4-18 and the Bucks are going to make a franchise record 3s  in Boston, I have some bad news for you..."
"It's also on a spot that doesn't really matter. It will almost always be hidden, from the front or back you wouldn't see it too well, and it's just lettering."
Refs pretty bad both ways honestly
That's Warriors legend and best free throw shooter I've ever seen
If I didn‚Äôt see both plays I would assume they were legit brawling out there with these injuries holy shit
Hardens eyes just keep flopping everywhere fucking call it already
"Paul tried to flop 


Lmao get fucked"
"Plenty of people discount some players because they played with greats lol, look at what‚Äôs happened to KD and Steph, Malone and Stockton, Bosh and Love, people even argue Jordan‚Äôs GOAT status because of Pippen.

Also he absolutely should get SOME discounting because he played with LeBron, unless we‚Äôre no longer discounting Steph and KD together..."
"Yeah lol unlike us, cause we're basketball geniuses with 500 IQ each respectively"
"Bucks in 4 or Celtics in 5, 6, or 7"
Not really my intention. Just tired of people treating the dubs like some scrappy underdog team that never complains.
Your timetable might not fit with the front office's
He's also active on the Nugget's sub. He's in a better place now.
the reports of Marv Albert's demise have not been exaggerated
at least Horford is dad dicking him
Dont say that. People dont like being reminded of that for some reason
It's not unusual for there to be a couple blowouts in a close series.
Playoff threads bring out the literal worst people on reddit. From every fan base.
Go check out his Instagram story
Refereeing has been fine this game
"Can anyone explain to me why Bucks fans are suddenly trying to act like bad asses?

I mean, let's all be honest with one another here, Boston's going to crush them at home. That's just a no go zone for opponents in the playoffs.

And I'm actually rooting for the Bucks so there's no hate. But come on guys, I at least understand that the Bucks are coming back home down 3-1."
5 FTA to 2. Am I doing this right?
FUCK DRAYMOND MAN FUCKKKK
I dislike Reggie Jackson
"Lightning doesn‚Äôt strike twice in the same place.. I recall this happened to LeBron during playoffs , or was it the finals ?"
"Giannis makes one dunk then starts flexing. Ok Westbrook, i see you."
"And yet, they always do. Over and over again."
"Ah, I see you're a man of culture."
Middleton is ugly as fuck
"Yeahhh, this was the Tyrone Corbin era. We don't talk about Tyrone Corbin."
"Which is insane. In church league, I have to be driven home in someone's trunk with tape over my mouth if I even jam my finger on an incoming pass. NBA players are like X-Men with their recoveries."
"The original ""blow a 3-1 lead""."
Massive travel by Giannis hot damn
"Serves harden right, flopping bitch"
How the fuck can you stand to watch that flopping shit team? Boring as fuck Basketball now their getting what they deserve. NO CALLS
robots about to take away jobs too
I feel like Curry could dislocate his finger in the middle of a game and people would still say he isn't hurt
He was bleeding from his eye...
Fuck Scott Foster he was literally in front of Harden fuck that shit seriously it‚Äôs annoying
Drinking game: take a shot of vodka for every time someone complains about the Ref in the match thread
"And for that, we‚Äôre thankful!"
what a retarded call
73 win team who needs the opposing teams star injured to win
Giannis can‚Äôt possibly win MVP after this choke..
Definitely seems like it
You say that like it's an auto win. As soon as Giannis figured out ur defense yall start getting blown out by 30+.
He rarely gets to the line. His game is avoiding contact not seeking it.
"Bet anyone reading this platinum that it‚Äôs over in 5, Warriors win."
You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the game üòÇ
But Paul Pierce told me it was over
You can look up the quote.  He may be bending to the loud fringe minority online now though.
God damn it. I failed Dorris burkes asshole big time:/ I tried to make sure I didn't fuck it up too lmao
"Houston fans, what is your official excuse for this game?"
Bucks have to lose 2 to win in 6
Sorting this thread by controversial was one of the worst decisions I have ever made.
"Damn Steph just got an xray, diagnose, and treatment in like 5 minutes and I've been waiting like 4 months to get an appointment with a primary care about my side hurting all the time"
also a likely criminal conspirator.
He at least got his name right
D'antoni is no doctor in case you couldnt tell
"Some players are just instantly better when playing against some teams, Khris chose the Celtics lmao"
Easy. Pump fake on a guy 5 inches shorter than you and then bring the ball down to your hip
Gordon Hayward in shambles
Thank you for believing in me.
"I couldn't care less about the MVP at this point. Harden and others have been dicked before, shits meaningless. I just want to beat the warriors man:/"
Refs banging 3s from the corner goddamn 8 on 5
I‚Äôm glad we all now know what you think
It's 64% if I've done my math right. 35/55 from three over those nine games.
Try to take over the world wait...
I really hate that guy :)
He came off the bench in Houston lol
We down by like 80 Middleton ain't coming back in
Harden got his dead shot eye on now
Imagine Marv trying to spell Antetokounmpo
Yeah a game at 430 for the entire West coast would be so much better
there was a foul on the drive anyways so stfu
I‚Äôm not a racist or a sexist. I can safely say that. What he says has literally zero meaning to me and I only support him for the tax cuts I get.
Why is that a thing bro
Status symbol? Who the fuck is trying to just *look* like an addict?
"Deep in the recesses of Oracle arena, there exists a whiteboard with a single word, circled multiple times: Jerebko"
Stop it. We played you guys 4 years straight. Steph would dramatically flail his body and get every call possible. Dude is one step under harden with that shit.
"Celtics exposed, Brad Stevens a regular season coach, dumb takes after one game, etc"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/biedae


This entire thread lol. Shits ridiculous"
This halftime show is ROUGH
"Rich coming from a 76ers fan that was bailed out by the refs lmao. Nurse tech while walkinh away, Butler 5 point play instead of an offensive foul, your coach walking in the path of Kawhi with no tech and to top it off. Raptors with more paint points but less free throws."
PRINTED ON PAPER. HUNG ON FRIDGE.
Bro the warriors are lucky that Shumpert couldn‚Äôt hit the side of the barn
You act like he doesn't have his whole career ahead of him

"Everyone in this thread: Bucks gotta stop jacking up 3s

Bucks: Fuck you, lol"
0 FTA's on a bunch of drives with a bunch of contact.

No one knows if you're hurt for real now."
oh my god thats one of the worst calls ive ever seen
"i mean the other way around, never wished bad on steph, meant karma for hte fans wishing steph is injured, karma comes around for them"
He shot himself and claims he was too wasted to know if he shot himself or if someone else shot him.
"Really rough series for him so far

EDIT: lmaoo why tf was this gilded"
fr why does this game have to be 9:30 central? Could we have not gotten an hour earlier
Imagine if /r/NBA managed teams
I surprised they are only down by 9.
"Run from it. 

Hide from it. 

In the end, you gon [get got] ( https://imgur.com/fjXf15p.gif)"
Gordon Hayward is so handsome
"It's going to end with a Jokic circus shot or a Lillard logo shot 


Those are the only options"
He‚Äôs so round x 4
They won more games in the season so he‚Äôs not wrong
Ready for the Westbrook stat pad comments
"I appreciate the elaboration, but this guy is a first year NBA coach having a hell of a season. Let‚Äôs be a little forgiving here."
It‚Äôs more the fact that biased and bias don‚Äôt sound all that different from one another. People don‚Äôt consider the grammar they just go by their ear.
The elected him dummy
brown is 5/5 from the line it's over
"I just scrolled through your comment history real quick. You've got a lot of pain/hatred that you're projecting on the rest of the world. I know life sucks, but there's a better outlet for your frustration"
"I knew as soon as I saw this, I knew exactly what it would look like if I sorted by controversial.

THAT subreddit must have a sixth sense for whenever their glorious leader is mocked. It must be exhausting."
"my favorite player of all time. could have gone to the draft earlier, but stuck around and swept all the POY awards. helmed the 2009 campaign when the tar heels absolute destroyed every single team they played in the tournament, including making draymond green his bitch in the title game. finished not only as UNC's all time leading scorer, but the all time leading scorer for the ACC. had a nice little career in the pros, which produced some pretty hilarious moments.

still balling in china, and a podcaster now to boot.  I love you, psycho T."
Y‚Äôall are some big ol‚Äô nephews for overreacting to game 1
"Chuck is the one to talk, hasn't won anything in his life."
"Easily one of the most formidable lineup on paper. : 

Sabonis/Dale Davis
Sheed/Grant
Pippen/Augmon
Smith/Bonzi
Stoudamire"
"One day: ""Donny has to chuck all those shots cause his teammates aren't very good""

Next day: ""Don't forget the Jazz are still a pretty good team"""
Give Harden a Shirley Temple and tell him to fuck off from this sport
"Certainly repetitive, as well"
Utah is not that big of a market
"Oh shut the fuck up, it was an accident."
"""Except for the walls and gates around my house"""
How much time do you spend discussing science with flat earthers?
Not as sad as you
"Petulant is the right word for CP3, but I think Draymond is the biggest complainer in the league. I wouldn‚Äôt call him petulant tho, just loud and annoying"
"Almost like it's harder when you're the first option and not playing with LeBron 

Wish someone could have predicted that..."
"&gt;Friendly reminder that while Harden laid on the ground clutching at his  face, the crowd booed him. Fuck Warriors fans. Trash people.

not just in reddit"
"If you aren't doing this you should be, and if the NBA doesn't do it themselves on their officials to give them the data on what they do and the tendencies they have, they should be. This is the 21st century and everything is driven by data and if the refs don't have this data themselves in their hands the NBA needs to wake up."
He's made of shambles
Sniper must‚Äôve gotten Harden
Hope he isn‚Äôt actually injured
"Capela isn‚Äôt usually this soft, so annoying"
I think he‚Äôll be the 3rd option behind Kyrie and AD next year lol
That kicked ball cost the Warriors 2.1 points
Rockets +18 from three being -1 eye. Incredible
GSW:Stacked.Always getting help from the refs.Causing injuriies to the opponents best player.
Brooklyn will stay with the knicks lmaaaoooo
Damn Bucks are pouring it ON
#**THE WARRIORS BLEW A 3-1 LEAD**
This seems like bait
200 iq 5Head move
Refs really trying to keep the Bucks in it here lmao these calls
Geez the Celtics really have this Bucks squad figured out
That‚Äôs not how that works...
"""It was halftime, and I was like where's Nikola Jokic, where's the big fella at? Turns out he was on the loading dock, downing a two liter of coke."" - Gary Harris on Nikola Jokic"
Believe it or not he said similar things when he was drafted by Utah
hes 50 and retired he can get as fat as he wants
"It's funny you ask because Ive been thinking about that with him out of the playoffs and I honestly don't know. The closest team geographically to me is the Raptors but I've never felt much connection with them. 

I've been a fan of LeBron since 02 so it's basically the only way I've ever known the NBA is to root for him. It's been a pretty fun and unique experience because as you can see I'm shameless about it. I love the game so I'll always watch but as to where my fandom goes its up in the air. Kind of excited to find out though."
Eyes are important for basketball
"Ohkay refs. Cmon now. Giannis definitely jump stopped and then took a step a bit ago. And that ""steal"" was a foul. You're supposed to be the best in the world at this reffing stuff. Figure it out."
Username doesn‚Äôt seem very correct
Now they are saying it‚Äôs a long two.
if you breathe near giannis a guy that is so fast and strong and he gets free throws lmao + traveled like 50 times in this game got uncalled
Your mom would be proud. Congrats on finally not getting swept finally.
Have you played basketball before? It's the first thing any defense does. It stops working at the  high school level
Off-topic but I guess Enes Kanter is a [sith lord now](https://twitter.com/Enes_Kanter/status/1123431400470978565)
"*strolls into the game thread*

""Harden FLLOOP""

""HE ONLY GOT POKE IN THE EYE, GET UP AND PLAY D""

""THE REFS ARE SCREWING US ALREADY"" 

...yeah I'm going to bed I'll watch the highlights"
"Harden: bleeding from the eye

Game Thread: LOL FUCKING FLOPDEN AMIRITE"
dude got fucking poked in the eye how is that not called
Imagine if harden came out with an eyepatch on
You mean the (((bucks)))
Harden back out here with the permanent stank eye
Only cuz she leaves when you put it on
Luckily most the mouth breathers are football fans. Chuck is a national treasure!
"There's plenty of wiggle room between regular flopping and staying on the floor in pain.

Only other time he's done this was last year against the Lakers. Even though he ended up having an injured hamstring, this sub had the same reaction."
Being a Bulls fan.
This guy efficient at injuring players without ruining their careers
I have no proof but I somehow know in my soul this is true.
Its true. People don't wanna hear the truth because its not WOKE
Where was the FUCKING FOUL?
Bucks having a historic night from deep tonight
"my fault, i phrased it badly"
"Not bloodshot, just red because he's been rubbing it the whole time"
I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw Livingston make a shot. He used to be automatic too
I honestly can't believe he came back in
Iguodala has had a great career
Wow...they pool their money and have 1/50th of ballmer..u sayin my mixtapes not gonna get me rich?
"Yeah, everyone knows its windmills that cause cancer"
Oof torn labia for Harden. Hate to see that
Yo dumbasses harden isnt on the fucking court so maybe the injury is real?
Also Chuck's fat ass is still healthier than 45's
they turned it over or missed on 16 straight possessions. not great
"I love doing that shit in 2k lol. 6'2"" guard coming in out of nowhere to block guys like AD"
And that's on a good day
That /r/NBA has a memory span of 2 days?
Anyone get the feeling Harden's eyes are fine and his eyes are red because he is a crybaby?
He flat out lied. Bucks were up 7 when Giannis scored 11 of their next 13 points to give them an 18 point lead with 2 min left in 3rd q. Subbed out right after that with 28 points.
What does that make Chris Paul then? Genghis Khan?
Tatum peaked as a rookie.
"I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong, I checked under my bed for Khris Middleton, but we won last time so I don‚Äôt really see the weight of that again beyond him having played well against us before. He hardly sonned us seeing as we won the series."
Bleeding from the eye fuck
Booing injuries. Now I see why everyone complimented GSW on their class after game 1
Harden is the Red eyes black dragon
Just for today I'm like fuck the celtics too. Pathetic shooting
spoken like a man who wants a long career in the nba after he retires.
Scary Terry has been scary for nobody except the Celtics this game
Jokic feasting on 2 liter cokes
"Problem is he makes them.   
The sway is excessive for contact, but it only impacts his shooting percentage a small amount.  


That is why he leads thew league in 4 point plays.   


He's basically kicking the defenders while still getting off a decent shot, if you don't hard contest he's still going to kick you, probably not get the call (because you pulled out) but will therefore get an uncontested 3 where the only downside is he will fall over, which he is used to by now.  


The worst part about all of this, it he is doing this cheesy shit, but he is legitimately good. It just ruins everything."
"Nice narrative.  I've spent a couple of minutes of my life on Facebook.  Go back to the drawing board.  Call me a bot, racist, or Nazi."
"Tbf, practicing with Harden has made him overestimate his strength"
"Link to the play: https://streamable.com/5j1hz

Definitely reckless. I've never seen someone contest horizontally with their hands before. Don't forget complaining about the foul call and him calling lebron a *fucking pussy* right after. Good ol'Draymond"
"This has 4-1 maybe 4-2 all over it. Tbh. 


Only team that I can see that can play with warriors is raptors"
"damn went over my head, but i still think timelord is worse, he can only dunk lmao"
Maybe because teams would rather load up on the greatest shooters &amp; scorer of all time so he‚Äôs getting wide open spoon-fed dunks.
He stepped on his foot
The first person in the world to get a Mike Scott tattoo
"Yes 2 times to players that are considered top 5 on the biggest stage. 

Due to his history of dirty plays we can‚Äôt rule it out"
But he has called Lopez Mirotic twice tonight
"when Malcolm Brogdan returns from the hyperbolic time chamber, what level super saiyan will he be?"
"Jesus Christ. First of all, Fox News is the most watched news channel in the US, they are the mainstream media. Second of all, you literally have never read the Washington Post or watched CNN if you actually think that. They are tilted left, but they go after Democrats all the time. Your cult leader has just brainwashed you to think otherwise"
White people love to say other white people are more gangsta than people when they obviously aren't
They want to see him fail just so they feel better about themselves.
He's a fucking warrior. A very good pick by Portland.
"Tbh I felt like it wasn't funny when I typed it. I just thought this sub would appreciate it. Oh well, my b"
"Now that I‚Äôve seen Harden‚Äôs eye dude should not be playing, at the very least he could wait until after halftime"
Paul Pierce put a curse on us
Some cities just aren't meant to have good basketball teams.
And you‚Äôll get downvoted while he gets upvoted. Shows the maturity of this sub
Giannis definitely shouldn‚Äôt get all those bogus calls in Boston though
Could return this game
"If that's how you want to rationalize your behavior, go ahead. The only person you're convincing is yourself and something tells me you're having trouble doing that. You feel the need to reaffirm your beliefs in a spiteful manner rather than seek understanding."

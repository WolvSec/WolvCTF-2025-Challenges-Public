# Reddit Hivemind

While everyone is here investing and trying to grow their net worth, the real ones are minmaxxing their reddit karma.  

Now here's my plan.  

To get reddit karma, we must get upvotes.  

To get upvotes, we must know what gives us upvotes.  

To know what gives us upvotes, we'll study this dataset I found of r/nba comments.  

Now let's put our knowledge to the test.  

Here's ~1000 comments with the labels removed. If you can give me a text file containing a list of (1) upvoted, (0) downvoted for the test list with good enough accuracy, I'll let you make comments on my account to farm karma for me.  

Example: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1  

(Note: These are actual reddit comments, this dataset does not represent the beliefs or values of WolvSec or WolvCTF. )  

## Stats

Solves: 34  
Point Value: 457

Nice work on the previous challenge! You managed to figure out how to upvote and downvote according to reddiquette  

We are one step away from bathing in reddit karma.  

Let's make sure we know what NOT to do, though, and try an experiment to get downvoted..  

Leave a comment that would get downvoted by r/nba, making sure it includes the word harden. (The name of current Clippers superstar James Harden)  

(You must score a 0.50 or lower on the model to be considered "downvoted")

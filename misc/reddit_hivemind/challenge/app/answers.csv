"It's just Harden fans reaching for straws. If they were really being honest, they would probably agree they aren't thrilled with his antics.

I think the most interesting thing to watch for in the coming years, if the NBA legislates all of Harden's antics out of the game, how good he can be without them.

I'm sure he will still be really good, but it would be crazy to see him become a regular all star and people having to admit he was only a top 5 player due to his antics.",0

Straight up for AD who says no?,1
If any of you have been smacked in the eye you know that shit hurts like hell.,1

Warriors ruined the Nba..,0
Chris Paul's flop was so goofy lol he's completely shameless. Fell down like he'd been shot and then looked at the ref. Just play the damn game,1
"Ignoring whether or not the game was rigged, I think it's fair to acknowledge that the refs have the ability to put a team in a position to gain momentum or lose it. For example, in game 4 of the 2017 finals, a bunch of the Warriors got into foul trouble during the 1st quarter. A bunch of the calls were pretty weak and even if they were all legit, it was inconsistent with how physically they had been letting those 3 series be played. 

In general, people are fouling all over the place. Refs can make correct calls to get players into foul trouble or choose between killing and allowing transition opportunities. Given how much easier it is to score in transition, all it takes is a short series of defensive ""stops"" combined with transition opportunities to create a 10 point swing. 

This is what happened in game 7. The Rockets were phenomenal on defense and the Warriors were struggling to score in the half court. Then sometime towards the end of the 3rd, early 4th, the Warriors had a series of physical defensive plays on Rockets drives that led to transition buckets and a momentum shift. I'm pretty sure that there were legit fouls on some of those plays that the refs could have called. It not only erased potential points from the Rockets, but also helped the Warriors score when they were having serious trouble against the Rockets defense. And while 0-27 is very real, I have to guess that part of the reason they favored the 3 ball so much at the end was that they weren't having success on those drives.",1
Dislocated middle finger on left hand. They zoomed in on that TNT overtime channel.,1
I feel the opposite,1
The Bucks beat the Pistons aka the worst playoff team of the decade and are struggling versus the very good Celtics. Very Underwhelming performance by Giannis so far.,1
Holy fuck shut up about the refs already,1
Warriors awful from 3 at 25%. Rockets amazing at 46%.,1
No I‚Äôm not trying to downplay it at all. I just meant that it seemed like they were making everything I was shocked to see it wasn‚Äôt even 50%,1
to be real i am on niether of those two platforms so i have no idea who is the biggest. i do know there was valuation not long ago where reddit users were at the lowest of the barrel. but to act like reddit or this place especially doesn't originate and produce quality shit that ripples high volume throughout the nba industry is retarded.,0

"This mentality people have is stupid. People say the same thing about CP3 and he is the opposite of Westbrook. There is no prerequisite for being a ""championship player"".

"I‚Äôm no CP3 stan by any means but Steve Javie was always my least favorite ref in the league right up until the day he retired. He was basically Scott Foster before Scott Foster. Dude had an ego the size of Jupiter when he was reffing games and always seemed to think he was there to be the star of the show. And to me, it also seems a little unprofessional for even a former ref to throw players under the bus, considering they‚Äôre supposed to be objective.

TLDR fuck the refs and Steve Javie in particular",1
I love how there's the conspiracy from some Celtics fans that the NBA wants them to lose this game so it's a longer series for money. Or that the MVP shouldn't be down 0-2. As a Sixers fan I know this pretty well - your team had a shit night and the Bucks had it going. Pack it up and move on. Accept the loss like big boys and dont blame the refs.,1
What about those 30 something games with Amare? I remember him balling out in the garden for a while. He had one game where he made the last shot but it was after the buzzer I believe. I think he scored like 30+ that game. I remember seeing the garden on tv and being kinda amazed at how loud it was.,1
I bet the concession stands in Milwaukee have great cheese items.,1
"I mean dude donated a huge portion of his salary to his community, just that‚Äôs enough to get my respect",1
Honestly imagine Harden with an eye patch and that beard. He could truly be the villain we deserve.,1

Too late to pucker up now MDA,1
I don't think so either. Draymond apologized on Hardens way out,1

"Yeah I made it 2 shots into this video and it‚Äôs a bad take. Really SVP? James Harden has to jump higher when he‚Äôs shooting over someone than over no one? It‚Äôs not comparable. Laughable take honestly. You‚Äôre absolutely correct. But then what standard are we setting? That offensive fouls on 3PAs must be compared to that particular player‚Äôs normal shooting form? So players should make their normal shooting form a kick-out-three? Nah. The NBA needs to write a fucking rule, and call it consistently.",1
blatant foul on draymond,0
I can‚Äôt begin to explain how much I agree with this statement.,1
This thread is really pretty right now. Almost no Boston fans posting and if we can get a bunch of people with no connection to Boston to shut the fuck up then we all win.,1
Single digit lead after that ugly half is a blessing for Houston,1
Lmao he‚Äôs really getting every call. I mean he hasn‚Äôt made a shot all game,1
Harden down like he got shot.,1

"Agree 100%. The Warriors should be so easy to root against with the stacked team, but on the court they're all amazing players playing the game the right way. Harden ain't even trying to make shots anymore, he tries to draw fouls with weird motions and exaggerations and if the shot actually goes in it's a bonus.",1

That's not what he means you dolt,1
"Because the Celtics defensive strategy is to have 2, sometimes 3/4 guys collapse on Giannis in the paint, pretty much conceding wide open 3s to us whenever we want.  It's not crazy for professional basketball players to shoot over 40% on wide open catch and shoot 3s.  We made some tough ones but also actually missed a ton of completely uncontested 3s.",1

That‚Äôs enough for us to determine that James Harden is playing bad,1
He is bad all the time he just hides it by being really fucking good,1
Don't kid yourselves Rockets fans. You'd still lose even with Harden.,0

Now they‚Äôre telling me the Bucks have lost home court advantage,1

Clean as fuck. Dude really gets every call,1
This game is going to be lit,1

Maybe it's Maybelline.",1
Ce;ltics have made some VERY tough shots. Gap should have been wider so far,0
Eye is part of the ball,1
Celtics defense fucks so hard,1
Next time we'll try the opposite strategy,1
"My absolute, #1 least favorite player to watch in the NBA. Embiid is up there as well but Harden easily takes the top spot. I only watch a few games of his each year but when a player's goal is ALWAYS to get to the free throw line by putting up a shot that looks vaguely similar to Will Smith's spin, behind the back, over the shoulder toss from the Fresh Prince intro, I cannot respect that player.",1
"I thought OP was trolling but he really deleted everything. Shit, this is crazy. Hope everything is well with him.",1
Just because he's willing to get his hands dirty for his own sake doesn't mean he'll do it for others. Sports mentality and business mentality don't mix often anyway.,1
Bruh you're lucky. You could've been nick furyd my dude,1
in the 54th minute he had 19 turnovers also,1
"Bucks: 10 more 3pt attempts, 6 fewer points in the paint = more free throw attempts than Celtics",0
I wish I got paid to run 50m down the court and fall on the ground to get a free foul call,0
I hate eye injuries,1
When your friend says it‚Äôs your turn to hit the blunt but you‚Äôre about to die,1
You mean the same thing they should have learned from the day they started watching the NBA. The overreactions and hot takes after an unexpected game 1 win are always hilarious.,1
Refs plus eye pokes = win,0
"our offense DIES in games sometimes, only makes it worse that we shoot a lot of threes and barely any free throws. i really wish we got to the line more.",1
They are killing us from 3 tonight.,1
"People like scoring, people don't like breaks. 

Free throws actually create issues for the business. It isn't like a proper break in play where you can run an advert, they're boring and tedious from a spectator perspective, they extend the game, they also destroy any flow in the game.

Time outs work well because quite often they either come at the end of the run so it's either 'fuck yeah, waste a time-out because we're killing you' or 'holy shit, thank Christ now let's see if we can gather our composure and make a comeback'. So there's some element of suspense during. Even at the end of games it's often to draw up a play.

The NBA want the game to be free-flowing, high scoring and as many dunks and threes as possible. They don't want someone shooting 20+ FTs a night unless they can work out a way to better monetise them.",1
Yeah that‚Äôs a cursed image,1
"To be fair, unless a top 2 pick ends up on the table he‚Äôs still by far the most valuable piece being discussed right now.",0
Look how disorganized Celtics look from 1 PNR with GIannis,0
That's a broken finger. Curry's done. The Warriors are done. Who do you guys think will win it all now?,0
I‚Äôm shocked Tatum hasn‚Äôt gotten more shit so far. He‚Äôs been absolute garbage.,1
Fuck all of yall shitting on the eye injury.,1
Middleton in the playoffs vs Boston is legitimately as good as Curry though and that's not really a hot take.,1
"Harden's eyes do not look that fucking bad, give me a break.",0
They also buttfucked little boys and kept slaves.,1
This is the Celtics I remember from regular season.,1
"summary: vince signed a (2?  3?  year) extension with the raps with the promise the management at the time was going to build a competitive team around him, but they had other ideas once glen grunwald got fired.  rob babcock, the interim GM, was tasked with trading him.  vince started acting out - saying stuff like ""I'll never dunk again"", stopped giving any semblance of an effort that should be expected of a pro athlete, etc.  eventually babcock traded him to the nets for peanuts.

fans i think have largely moved on given he got that nice ovation a couple of years ago as a member of the grizzlies, but he's never publically apologized for what went down in that last year in toronto.",1
That extra long pinky nail.,1
"*The hottest player in these playoffs is Kevin Durant*

Reggie outted",1
And seven turnovers and 5 flex and yell celebrations,1
people legit happy harden is hurt. yall are disgusting,1
"Lost in all this is the fact the refs has 0 impact that quarter

It was nice to see some back and forth basketball for once",1
"Flopping isn't even the main problem. It's jumping into people, hooking their arms, or kicking out his leg to manufacture contact.",1
"Rockets had a terrible half and are only down 9. Double digit turnovers, Harden injury, House's minutes. They can still steal this one.",1
Oh poor baby Giannis didn‚Äôt get bailed out again,1
"Serious question: how many times have the Warriors players injured/harmed the other team's key player in a playoff series? (I'm not saying they \*intentionally\* did it - other than the Kawhi injury - but just curious)

\- Kyrie (Klay incidental knee contact)

\- LeBron (Eye pokes)

\- Kawhi (stepping under his shot)

\- Harden (eye poke)

\- Steven Adam's (his horse sized testicles took a beating by Draymond)

\- Aldridge? (I vaguely remember something with players getting under him... or was hestepping under Durant?)",0
this sounds like a Chris Smoove video,1
And then when Mirotic shot he called him Lopez,1
"I've watched that ""final 4 minutes of Game 7"" video the NBA released at least 10 times. Always puts me in a better mood.",1
Can you guys believe the amount of trash talking Draymond does? He's lucky I'm not on the court. I have a zero-tolerance policy for trash talkers.,0
Hayward actually does. He's just not a high usage player for us so the raw numbers aren't great.,1
Don‚Äôt kick them while they‚Äôre down,1
Get up of the ground man.. you barely got touched. That's just embarrassing for the rockets,0
Draymond is a cheater and the refs hate Harden. Pretty simple,0
Lmao im Mexican bruh,0
"In b4 the ""reFS hANdeD hIM tHe wiN""",1
yeah this didn't seem noteworthy at all,1
"C‚Äôs  looking like the pacers in the third quarter feels good

Edit: Boston fans plz don‚Äôt downvote it‚Äôs a joke it‚Äôs hard for me to route against brad, and Hayward",0
Could you imagine being his friend in real life and trying to have conversations with him?,1
Kyrie's leadership is blaming others for his bad passes LOL,1
#THE REFS CAUSED THE ROCKETS TO TURN THE BALL OVER 9 TIMES IN THE QUARTER.,1
I would be kicked out of the NBA so fucking fast if I were in their position. I would not be able to keep my cool and swing at a ref within half a fucking season haha I get how hard the refs job is but I could just not keep my cool.,0
"I mean, he's done it before.",0
A steady 3 point shooter particularly from 3. That dude senile. Ian eagle deserves that job right now,1
More valuable than ball + Ingram + kuzma? Lol,1
"Is it just me, or did this game start exceptionally early/on time?",1
They had their best season in franchise history last year.,0
"Can we just have Kevin Harlan call all the games?

I don't fucking care how we do it: clone him, hire Kevin Harlan impersonators, splice together Kevin Harlan voice clips on a computer, breach the time-space continuum to grab multiple Kevin Harlans from various timelines/universes.

I just want him to call the playoff games. Marv needs to go.",1
Enes probably tells every girl he loves them,1
"The analogy is this: The teacher (Scott Foster) is good at her job based on the criteria the school (NBA) set for her. Her students pass their tests (when they review his calls they pass the standards for accuracy), she keeps the students behavior in check (he keeps the player's behavior in check), and she has tenure (he has tenure). It's not part of her (his) job to make her students (players and fans) think she's nice.",1
Not in a 4 game sweep,1
"He shot 61% from 3 against Boston in the 7-game series last season, and is currently shooting 71% from 3 so far this year (10/14 across 2 games).",1
Might wanna take another stab at that,1
If you think Durant isn‚Äôt the best Warrior or even the best player in the world you haven‚Äôt been watching this series.,1
"Im not defending Harden or saying SC did this, but couldn't you just cherry pick shots to fit the narrative your trying to push? He took a fuckload of threes during the season, there are probably instances of him landing all manner of directions. I think it better proves intent if you show me the two happening repeatedly in the same game.",1
You‚Äôre childish if you think he flopped on that,1
People talked about Horford like he was a god after game 1. If you‚Äôve never watched the playoffs before he‚Äôs the most inconsistent player,0
He says this about every team he‚Äôs on,1
Said something like the only walls are the ones that are forming in his arteries and called him a fat fuck,1
Barely but you get used to it. Still better than being a Knicks or Washington fan.,1
UNDERDOG PUT THAT ON A T-SHIRT,1
He does rival Blake Griffin for the 2nd worst footwork in the league,0
An inconspicuous brown spot on his shorts as well,1
"That‚Äôs why Draymond lost all that weight, so his spindly little fingers would more easily fit in people‚Äôs eye sockets!",0
"thats it nephew, give me your keyboard",1
His finger looked a bit messed up. Ah shit.,1
Go back and watch Kyrie's highlights in the Finals vs the warriors.  Pretty much everything he did was going 1v1 and cooking Klay and co.  Lebron doesn't have that much to do with Kyrie's INDIVIDUAL play that he showcased in the Finals.  It's not like Lebron was setting him up over and over.,1
WTF is wrong with you?,1
What is the hive?,1
Sounds like you don't understand much of anything if it's not spoon-fed to you in a special interest Facebook post,1

"The skirt thing is kinda funny, to each his own I guess. The assault is just nasty though.",1
"You realize that the money we've invested in border control over the last 15 years has been effective right? Nine years ago we passed a point where visa over-stayers passed the amount of border-crossers we get per year. Yet your plan is to invest 80 billion dollars of tax money to make a wall. If you want to take that much money from our country, it has to go to something that will be useful. A wall that can be beat with a ladder won't do a single thing.

We need to bring the amount of visa-overstayers back down under border-crossers before we even think about investing 80 billion dollars into border control.",1
Can‚Äôt play Boston in Finals,1
Love it but Chuck in a Celtics jersey just feels...wrong.,1
"Yep, I especially liked that one play where he passed to Ersan for the mid ranger when they doubled him on his drive. He is improving but still not his normal self yet in my opinion.",1

"Rivers tried to get up but he flopped back down again, Jerebko tried to help him up with a little kick lol",1
"No doubt. Lots of respect for him, would love to have him as an announcer one day (even though I know he does Nets and cavs? games right now).",1
Yeah let's attack the guy who got slapped in the face. You can do literally anything to Harden and this sub will cheer if it's not called a foul.,0
&gt; I was breaking...him ... I was just... best... I also said he was ... ass...,1
"Almost sounded like he said ""think I broke it...""",1
They would sweat that shit off in about 30 seconds,1
"Hey guys, just wanted to say, these are great takes.",1
Great example of a wall not working.,1
I like this mostly because his single game +/- swung by 34 points even though he was shit in both games. Should tell you everything you need to know about that stat.,1
"Probably not, unless TBD is going to be KD.",1
well at least now curry fangirls have an excuse for when he's struggling.,0
"Dude it literally came out they are targeting Stephs ankles, how are you ok with this",0
"I still don't get this sentiment. If walls ""don't work"" or are even ""immoral"" shouldn't we be demolishing what we currently have? 

I'm not a Trump supporter and don't even have a strong desire for more ""wall"" to be added, but it just seems like rhetoric to hate Trump on, rather than actually addressing the matter or any principled stance.",0
"build a firewall too, duh",1
Wait wtf. Did this game start on time?,1
"Beadle will then proceed to roast him, and Jalen willingly joins in.",1

Harden really investing in this flop,1
"""Wait, now they're saying it was Bed, Bath and Biyombo""",1
"I hope none of you Warrior fans are under the collective delusion that your precious team was built by merit. You may not notice, but history will, that the only thing separating the 2014-2019 Golden State Warriors from every other team is that they just so happened to have been the most talented team the exact year the salary cap jumped by 30%.",0
2009 Lebron could never have done what 2016 Lebron did,1
Giannis is the James Harden of big men,1
Can I pay for more tho?,1
"Wait, his feet went forward, why'd he even try to shoot it at that point, he was just throwing his feet forward fishing for a foul",1
There is a difference making an observation or have a take to calling Giannis useless and people uprove it .,1
"Literally zero skill involved 

Just bulls his way in and gets free throws no matter what",0
Aw man the guy roots for his team I guess he‚Äôs irrational /s. You‚Äôre being a goober,1
"To be fair, I believe that his foot was on the foul line right at the elbow when he took the shot.",1
Who here has said he‚Äôs a very intelligent person... link ??? Or is this just a circlejerk comment,0

what in the world?,1
Chuck doesn't care about poor Americans that can't get entry level jobs because they don't know a foreign language.,0
Someone get him a pirate patch and a gold tooth,1
"If the Rockets win, ya'll need to put some respect on Austin Rivers for holding it down when Harden was out. Nothing short of a statue outside the arena for sure",1
The bucks can‚Äôt rely on shooting 50% from 3 to get such a big lead. Non calls in the third for the Celtics while calling fouls on clean blocks/sending the Bucks to the line on that run ended the game. Kyrie played horrible but the refs were completely one way that third quarter and it completely shifted the game. Free throw numbers being close at the end doesn‚Äôt matter when we shot 11 in the last 6 minutes. Hope Kyrie and Gordon play better on Friday.,0

draymonds finger sure loves the eyes of the opposing superstar. lebron last year harden this year,1
No the Trailblazers problem is that they have nobody to stop Jokic.,1
Giannis style of play even more annoying than James Harden,1
love how no one replies,0
If only Khris had some name that rhymed with scary or something. This dude deserves that (though Terry does seem to elevate his play a bit in the playoffs),1
"Something about Draymond doing too much but is blown off by saying, ""he plays with passion...""",1
Their team last year was at least on the same level as those championship teams.,0
that is indeed what I just said,0

Fuck Draymond an these refs,0

That was a nasty move by harden on iggy,1
"The fuck are u saying?


What is this, a comment for ants?",1
Shhh Its 6am and im tryna watch the game quietly,1
The refs aren‚Äôt the reason we‚Äôre down (missed shots and turnovers) but they do change up the flow of the game easily. The moment tick tacky fouls are called on one end and not on the other leads to inconsistency on the defensive and offensive end. It‚Äôs so simple for anyone who actually plays basketball.,0
All the nephews come out to play after each game. You don‚Äôt know what each thread will consist of until you open up the thread.,1
"Michael Jordan was right, Republicans buy Nike Shoes too. or something like that. I woudn't be surprised if many of the players, coaches, front office people in the NBA are conservative but stay quiet because of the possible backlash on social media.",0

"It's easy, Middleton just has to go 7-10 from 3 every night and hold Kyrie to single digit scoring and this series is over and done with üòè",0
That replay looked like he was barely grazed,1
"I hope everyone notices the absolutely fucking ridiculous calls that Giannis gets. Baynes has his hands straight up, feet set, foul called cause Antetrevelko runs into him",1
The Celtics got away from LeBron in the playoffs and now they have to play Middelton every playoffs now. Tough luck,1
It‚Äôs easy to talk yourself into someone having a chance to beat the Warriors until you actually watch the Warriors play. This is honestly beautiful basketball.,1
They told me Celtics in 4,1
Dude look what happened to Kermit Washington.  If they allowed fighting someone would get killed.,1
Thank you omg. The amount of times I've seen people compare immigration to a home intrusion without a hint of irony is insane.,1
Brandon Ingram ranks 11th btw.,1
KD is allergic to actual adversity. It'll be too funny when he leaves and gets exposed next year,0
"I swear we did something similar one year in playoffs, because I remember watching and laughing at all the the foul draw attempts against people who have their hands back like that neil degrasse meme",1
"Pack it up on this one, Bucks shooting out of their minds, we can't hit anything open, and refs have instructions signed in blood to put Giannis to the line even if he knifes his defender. Take it back to Boston and take care of business.",0
dude stfu cp3 is not going to attempt to injure someone. don't just throw out wild shit like that without evidence,0
Bucks just needed some time to readjust to high level basketball. They had to dink around with the Pistons the first 4 games,1
They were both clocked by Lakers,1
Not as good as vs OKC Wiggins,1
"You better not OP, you better not start this shit.",0

U lost home court already lol,0
Just move to the mountain time zone. All games start and end at a reasonable hour.,1
"Here's some actual basketball knowledge for the ignorant fans who just wanna take cheap shots at each other.

The adjustment to put Hill on Kyrie and Bledsoe on Brown. Was key. Means Mirotic guards Morris. Much better match ups all around.

That was a great move by Bud.

See you idiots on Friday.",1
There was also a play where Horford slaps Giannis‚Äô wrist/forearm causing a turnover. That didn‚Äôt seem to stop the basketball team from being motivated to play basketball.,1
"Averaging 34/9/9 across something like 22 postseason games, the most 40-point games in a single postseason run, the 51/8/8 game... one of the craziest playoff performances I‚Äôve ever seen.",1

"Could someone please help me find the link? I would be so gosh darn thankful if you could.  Not only was it a clear offensive foul, but this guy couldn't even move al hordord an inch.

"Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero.",1
"Marv keeps calling Lopez Mirotic, time to hang it up old man",1

And his reward is them to look the other way as he gets undercut on 3pt attempts.,0
Do the Knicks know?,1
"Players were all over the court as well, Boston had horrible spacing. 

Also guys trying to iso down Giannis for long two's? Shot selection was extremely suspect too.",1
I‚Äôd rather this series be decided by the refs than injuries,1
they still got conquered by the mongols,1
LeBron letting the east get to the finals,1
This is basically the worst series ever,1
"That's good for Marv lmao. Not exactly a mistake, just redundant",1
Damn this man is so committed to the flop that he went into the locker room and stabbed his eyes with a needle /s,1
It was also superfolous,1
"Look at his glasses, he's obv smart",1
Too many 7‚Äô white guys shooting 3s for Marv to keep track of,1
Lol Draymond hasn't made a 3 in 6 games then that one doesn't count,1
Really shows the difference between a player with pure skill and a player on a better coached team.,1
Kyrie saw Giannis's G1 and raised.  Bold strategy.,1
If you don't want to see a Chuck vs Trump fight then I don't want to be your friend.,1
KD: ‚ÄúI was having a hard time making a decision and my dear friend James reminded me what he does in difficult situations. Put one foot in front of the other. That‚Äôs I knew Houston was the perfect place for me.‚Äù,1
Same with the game 5 highlights where LeBron and Kyrie both drop 41 at oracle. The progression in the highlights where the fans are booing LeBron every time he touches the ball and he just hits every single shot then eventually they shut up after they realize he‚Äôs shitting on them.,1
I‚Äôd eat burgers with him anytime,1
"it‚Äôs actually the opposite. You get the force of ur shot from ur legs, bigger stronger dudes have to exert less to shoot the ball, so they jump less. Watch horford or Brook Lopez shoot a 3 they don‚Äôt even jump at all basically",1
"I know Bucks history posts have been done to death but their history is ridiculous. They were nearly always competitive throughout the 70s and 80s, didn't do much at all in the 90s, had one good year in 2000-01, and now I dare say they are back. This is easily the best Bucks team since 2000-01 and arguably the best since KAJ was a Buck",1
"Alright fellas I‚Äôm out, gotta study and rest up for my first final tomorrow morning",1
This boutta be the most toxic /r/NBA game thread of all time,1
Please continue to guard Horford with Lopez,1
Lmao imagine the Boston crowd if Giannis gets away with all those travels next game,0
I‚Äôm a Rockets fan and I don‚Äôt think that. Every team has floppers or people bitching about the refs (including the Rockets of course) and I really just wish they would all shut the fuck up.,1

Definitely seems like it,0
You say that like it's an auto win. As soon as Giannis figured out ur defense yall start getting blown out by 30+.,1
He rarely gets to the line. His game is avoiding contact not seeking it.,1
"Bet anyone reading this platinum that it‚Äôs over in 5, Warriors win.",0
You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the game üòÇ,0
But Paul Pierce told me it was over,1
You can look up the quote.  He may be bending to the loud fringe minority online now though.,0
God damn it. I failed Dorris burkes asshole big time:/ I tried to make sure I didn't fuck it up too lmao,0

Gordon Hayward in shambles,1
Thank you for believing in me.,1
"I couldn't care less about the MVP at this point. Harden and others have been dicked before, shits meaningless. I just want to beat the warriors man:/",0
Refs banging 3s from the corner goddamn 8 on 5,1
I‚Äôm glad we all now know what you think,1
It's 64% if I've done my math right. 35/55 from three over those nine games.,1
Try to take over the world wait...,1
I really hate that guy :),1
He came off the bench in Houston lol,1
We down by like 80 Middleton ain't coming back in,1
Harden got his dead shot eye on now,1
Imagine Marv trying to spell Antetokounmpo,1
Yeah a game at 430 for the entire West coast would be so much better,1
there was a foul on the drive anyways so stfu,0
I‚Äôm not a racist or a sexist. I can safely say that. What he says has literally zero meaning to me and I only support him for the tax cuts I get.,0
Why is that a thing bro,1
Status symbol? Who the fuck is trying to just *look* like an addict?,1
"Deep in the recesses of Oracle arena, there exists a whiteboard with a single word, circled multiple times: Jerebko",1
Stop it. We played you guys 4 years straight. Steph would dramatically flail his body and get every call possible. Dude is one step under harden with that shit.,0

This halftime show is ROUGH,1
"Rich coming from a 76ers fan that was bailed out by the refs lmao. Nurse tech while walkinh away, Butler 5 point play instead of an offensive foul, your coach walking in the path of Kawhi with no tech and to top it off. Raptors with more paint points but less free throws.",0
PRINTED ON PAPER. HUNG ON FRIDGE.,1

Ready for the Westbrook stat pad comments,1
"I appreciate the elaboration, but this guy is a first year NBA coach having a hell of a season. Let‚Äôs be a little forgiving here.",1
It‚Äôs more the fact that biased and bias don‚Äôt sound all that different from one another. People don‚Äôt consider the grammar they just go by their ear.,1

"my favorite player of all time. could have gone to the draft earlier, but stuck around and swept all the POY awards. helmed the 2009 campaign when the tar heels absolute destroyed every single team they played in the tournament, including making draymond green his bitch in the title game. finished not only as UNC's all time leading scorer, but the all time leading scorer for the ACC. had a nice little career in the pros, which produced some pretty hilarious moments.

"If you aren't doing this you should be, and if the NBA doesn't do it themselves on their officials to give them the data on what they do and the tendencies they have, they should be.

Hope he isn‚Äôt actually injured,1

hes 50 and retired he can get as fat as he wants,1
"It's funny you ask because Ive been thinking about that with him out of the playoffs and I honestly don't know. The closest team geographically to me is the Raptors but I've never felt much connection with them. 

I've been a fan of LeBron since 02 so it's basically the only way I've ever known the NBA is to root for him. It's been a pretty fun and unique experience because as you can see I'm shameless about it. I love the game so I'll always watch but as to where my fandom goes its up in the air. Kind of excited to find out though.",1
Eyes are important for basketball,1
"Ohkay refs. Cmon now. Giannis definitely jump stopped and then took a step a bit ago. And that ""steal"" was a foul. You're supposed to be the best in the world at this reffing stuff. Figure it out.",1

Now they are saying it‚Äôs a long two.,1
if you breathe near giannis a guy that is so fast and strong and he gets free throws lmao + traveled like 50 times in this game got uncalled,0
Your mom would be proud. Congrats on finally not getting swept finally.,0
Have you played basketball before? It's the first thing any defense does. It stops working at the  high school level,1

Harden back out here with the permanent stank eye,1
Only cuz she leaves when you put it on,1
Luckily most the mouth breathers are football fans. Chuck is a national treasure!,1
"There's plenty of wiggle room between regular flopping and staying on the floor in pain.

Being a Bulls fan.,1

I have no proof but I somehow know in my soul this is true.,1
Its true. People don't wanna hear the truth because its not WOKE,0

Oof torn labia for Harden. Hate to see that,1
Yo dumbasses harden isnt on the fucking court so maybe the injury is real?,1
Also Chuck's fat ass is still healthier than 45's,1
they turned it over or missed on 16 straight possessions. not great,1

That /r/NBA has a memory span of 2 days?,1
Anyone get the feeling Harden's eyes are fine and his eyes are red because he is a crybaby?,0
He flat out lied. Bucks were up 7 when Giannis scored 11 of their next 13 points to give them an 18 point lead with 2 min left in 3rd q. Subbed out right after that with 28 points.,1
What does that make Chris Paul then? Genghis Khan?,1
Tatum peaked as a rookie.,1

Scary Terry has been scary for nobody except the Celtics this game,1
Jokic feasting on 2 liter cokes,1
"Problem is he makes them.   
The sway is excessive for contact, but it only impacts his shooting percentage a small amount.  


That is why he leads thew league in 4 point plays.   


He's basically kicking the defenders while still getting off a decent shot, if you don't hard contest he's still going to kick you, probably not get the call (because you pulled out) but will therefore get an uncontested 3 where the only downside is he will fall over, which he is used to by now.  


The worst part about all of this, it he is doing this cheesy shit, but he is legitimately good. It just ruins everything.",1
"Nice narrative.  I've spent a couple of minutes of my life on Facebook.  Go back to the drawing board.  Call me a bot, racist, or Nazi.",0
"Tbf, practicing with Harden has made him overestimate his strength",1
"Link to the play: https://streamable.com/5j1hz

Definitely reckless. I've never seen someone contest horizontally with their hands before. Don't forget complaining about the foul call and him calling lebron a *fucking pussy* right after. Good ol'Draymond",1
"This has 4-1 maybe 4-2 all over it. Tbh. 


Only team that I can see that can play with warriors is raptors",0
"damn went over my head, but i still think timelord is worse, he can only dunk lmao",0
Maybe because teams would rather load up on the greatest shooters &amp; scorer of all time so he‚Äôs getting wide open spoon-fed dunks.,1
He stepped on his foot,0
The first person in the world to get a Mike Scott tattoo,1

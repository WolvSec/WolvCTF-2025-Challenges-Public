I don‚Äôt think these are intentional but I do think it‚Äôs not a coincidence that it keeps happening and it‚Äôs Draymond. Nobody‚Äôs really been able to keep him in check and sometimes he really gets overaggressive swinging his hands everywhere and accidents like this are more likely to happen,0

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, I'd much rather guys like Kyrie get the calls. But since the referees are extremely inconsistent on who gets calls (I.E KD or Giannis will get everything without much selling or embellishment, whereas Curry can fall over on threes as much as he wants he barely gets a damn thing) you cannot blame the guys until the referees do a better job calling a fair game",1

But this should result in him being more efficient.

He‚Äôs got to turn it around this series. He fluctuates between being tremendously over and underrated. Right now he‚Äôs a very talented young player with flashes of greatness but every time he has a great game everyone wants to crown him as ready right now. He‚Äôs clearly not.

Bucks shoot so many threes and can really get out in transition, so sometimes they'll go on a 12-0 run in a 90 second stretch out nowhere.

Game 1 felt weird for a lot of Bucks fans because everytime it looked like the run was going to happen, Boston answered the bell on both ends, and; IMO, the Bucks got into their own head a bit and stopped playing with any kind if rhythm.",1

"The celtics don't get to the line and don't get to the rim, they live by midrangers and three pointers. In game 1 the bucks didn't have the proper level of force and intensity when battling against endless DHOs and those deadly Irving/Horford PnPs. Still the celtics will have games when they make these shots and they have multiple shot creators who can create a decent midrange shot, which is the soft part of this bucks defence. 

Giannis had an awful game 1 not because of his poor shooting but poor decision making, he too often attacked blindly against a wall of Celtics defenders and wasn't a willing passer. This game he was completely different and was a lot more patient in attacking this style of defence. If the Celtics continue to play like then the Bucks will need to hit these deep threes to open up the corners and driving lanes. It's these 30 foot shots that break the Boston strategy of walling off Giannis drives with the weak and strong side wing. 

IMO I think the celtics will come out strong next game and abuse the Irving/Horford PnP, especially when Lopez is in the game.",1

While it is true that Lebron took a lion's share of the praise for the accomplishments of that Cleveland team, he also took a lion share of the blame when things didn't go right. Kyrie often escaped uncriticized even when he was ineffective/passive.

This isn't to say Kyrie isn't great. He is! Just look at his finals stats. But I think his playoff pedigree has become a bit overstated.",1

"I think CP's career took a drastic turn after 2011 Playoffs. CP used to be a hell of a player in New Orleans. When CP's Hornets went against Kobe's Lakers in 2011 playoffs, CP averaged 22 points and 11.5 assists in that series. While Kobe had 135 points total in the series, CP had 132. He almost matched Kobe in points while averaging 11.5 assists per game (Lakers win series 4-2). Personally, I think that was his best performance in the post-season. However, I feel like CP realized he can't just win by playing well, so he took flopping and other unlikable behaviors to next level in order to win (win by any means mentality). It's just sad to see his behaviors on display at times. CP used to be my favorite point guard in the league, now I can't even stand faces he makes when he is on the court. Really sad. I just feel like he is putting too much chip on his shoulder, therefore he has to act arrogant (confidence gone wrong) for him to feel like he isn't looked down on.",1

He could come back this game it Isn‚Äôt his shooting hand. I know Kobe and Rondo played with dislocated fingers in the playoffs.,1

Horford sonning Giannis lol,1
People tend to forget that the players aren‚Äôt the only ones watching game film. Refs are watching tape and seeing the players tendencies because it makes their own jobs easier when they can tell the difference in how a player reacts to contact. And then you have Harden snapping his head back when he gets slapped on the wrist. So the refs see how Harden reacts to every single foul and it makes it a lot more of a challenge for them in deterring if he‚Äôs actually fouled. Especially in the playoffs when they tend to swallow their whistle more.,1
I thought your eyes bleed when you use that. He's halfway there,1

"It's just really sad how bad our offense can be at times. So many bad fucking shots.

You can't do that with a team like this. It's the same with every team, but bad offense leads to good offense for the other team. You can't give a team with Giannis and shooters any extra time to push the ball. Defensive rebounds let that happen.",1

That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs SVP. He‚Äôs their saving grace.,1
Same happened with LeBron. They dared him to shoot rather than give him anything inside. LeBron then learned to shoot and it was game over. There‚Äôs just no solving it when a dominant big with guard skills learns how to shoot in the modern game. It‚Äôs the final form. Just look at Dirk for his whole career.,1

I mean just go into the gym and put some shots up, it‚Äôs easier jumping forward. The only reason to fade-away is to create space to get the shot off, it makes the shot more difficult, if u already have made space with the step back u don‚Äôt want to also fade",1
could make a drinking game out of it,1
One team tonight is crying and bitching about everything and it ain't the Rockets.,0
Except Giannis is showing signs of it. Unlike Simmons who hasn't yet (but still might),1

Like you remember the asian kid in trigonometry that takes one look at the graph and figures out the answer without even trying? Meanwhile, the rest of the class needs to have a cookie cutter recipe spoon fed to them by the teacher to understand how to do the problem. Its the same thing with social smarts as it is with book smarts. His brain recognizes these patterns more naturally than we do so to him, it doesnt seem like that big of a deal",1
"Between game 1 and the start of 4th quarter tonight, Bucks have something like 25 more ft attempted than the Celtics. I could see why they'd be frustrated.",1
Nobody said Celtics in 4. We were saying Celtics in 16. Don't overreact. Bucks shot out of their mind from 3. Historically calls favor the home team and so does shooting. Your boys shit away their home court game 1. Back down to earth Friday for you. Hang in there rook.,0

What Harden does is not 'basketball' in the pure sense of the word, the same way that effectively 'tricking' rating agencies into grading your garbage mortgage backed securities is not 'banking'. Harden (with the help of the Rockets organization. He isn't doing all this on his own) looks for flaws in the rulebook that make it hard for officials, the supposedly neutral arbiters that exist outside of the game and police the conduct of those playing the game, to enforce the rules consistent with 'the spirit of the rule'. He then tries to trick those officials.",1

If Walton is found not guilty, there will be far less doubt than a team of three men would leave, and if he's guilty, nobody blames the org for firing him based on the team's findings. 

I have to imagine they really do want him as their coach, but will not hesitate to cut ties if any foul play is afoot, and the best way to guarantee a lack of bias in favor of Luke is to hire a team of qualified women.",1

"#THIS COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG 

&gt; Center of gravity on a sweep and sway pretty much doesn't move at all.

How anyone who knows the phrase ""sweep and sway"" can say you pretty don't move at all is baffling to me. 

The sway explained by Pro Shot System:

https://youtu.be/bSJTs4Ton_U

You regularly jump forward on a true jumper, it's natural momentum and it help you guide the bull into the rim. SVP is showing a set shot, and when you have more time you want to minimize motion, so that's why Harden doesn't move as much. When you have a defender in your face, you need to elevate to generate space, leading you to sway and bring your body towards the basket. 

I hate to bang the ""blogbois who don't play should be quiet"" drum, but this is just straight up not true and should not be up voted. Fuck Harden but let's be honest with what we are discussing",1
Dude he travels while stiff arming and elbowing people every fucking drive.,0
Hope curry is alright. Wouldn't feel the same if he's injured.,1
does anyone else find it weird when they zoom in on the crowd at Oracle and you find you're watching middle aged tech dudes in suits screaming like primal animals,1

probably a lot of the coaches and front office people and team owners. years ago Sports Illustrated used to have these surveys sent out to the players of each league and you would see what %  are republican or democrat if they like Obama or Romney to win. I think they quit doing that. But it was interesting stats.,1
I hope both teams lose.,1

This series is over. It took Kyries worst game ever and the entire Celtics team to go ice cold for the bucks to win on the road. I could not be more relaxed about this series. My original prediction was Celtics in 6 but it could be 5.,0
Zero even though they should. If it‚Äôs a liberal circle jerk it‚Äôll stay,0

"Every once in while I get the urge to chime in on one of these anti-CP3 threads to tell this story and ask for help tracking down this segment:

Several years ago (pre-2014), I believe it was on Zach Lowe's podcast, a sportswriter (I want to say Arnovitz, but I'm not sure) relayed a story about interviewing CP3 where he got into a tense back-and-forth with CP around a series of 'spirit of the rule' type questions where he was asking him about whether or not he thought flopping, grabbing arms, and otherwise trying to do 'illegal' things on the court was 'moral' or within 'the spirit of the game/rule' and the sportswriter got really frustrated because CP was pretending to not understand the concept and conflating 'getting caught' with 'doing wrong'. Essentially, CP seems to believe that what makes a thing 'bad' is whether or not you are caught doing it. 

You can understand so much of CP's career in light of this comment. From the punching of dicks, the flopping, his routine excessive contact, etc. all of the things people dislike about CP are summed up in that exchange. He's an immoral, dirty basketball player that most importantly **should not be president of the NBA players' union** because he routinely shows little to no respect for his colleagues, as evidenced by his on court behavior.",1

"I think you're missing the point.  When players jump higher to shoot, players don't decide to where putting their feet makes the most ""sense"".  It's just the physics of launching the ball towards the rim.  When you jump higher, you're releasing your shot closer to the apex of your jump to elevate your release point above defenders.  And this part depends somewhat on your form, but your body naturally kind of bows to create a little extra push, and your legs sweep towards the rim a bit.",1

* In the first game Bucks shoot an abysmall 34% while Celtics shot 54%...it simply aint happening again.Bucks had their worst game.  Game 2   Bucks 44%--- Celtics 40%

* A very good game by Giannis. Boston defense was solid..but he didnt force it this time around..he found his teammates he played solid defense..and again made 2-4 on his 3s...And most importantly only 1 TO.

* Horrible game by Kyrie...as talented as he is u cant expect to make such tough shots every game, brand needs to help him.

* last but not least....it will be interesting tos ee if that Loss will shaken up their locker room...they had like what... 9-10 wins in a row?

* Bucks shot 42% from 3 thats a very good percentage still lower than the 48% of Boston last night. But Boston fans shouldnt expect a big balance out of it...too many open shots when Milwaukee shares the ball and Celtics move tot he center when Giannis drives",1

Once you get through those I can move on to all the racist things he's said in the one and a half years since the article was written.

tbh this would be true except the players got wrecked in the last CBA negotiations so clearly he's not great at that,1
The rest of the team played well,1
Nah he‚Äôs been pretty decent this game imo,1
Frazier just did exactly what Giannis does and got called for it. Huh,0
"At least Rockets fans can hang their hat on losing this series because of Harden's ""injury""",0

"The level of intensity for the bucks in this game was beautiful, on both ends. The bucks played way too passive on defence last game and their guards died too quickly on those Kyrie/Horsford PnPs and on the those DHOs, which gave Boston all those clear mid-range and three point shots. The bucks defence has been built on protecting the paint and limiting teams at the free throw line but they concede a lot of midrangers and above the break three pointers. They're able to do this because of the athleticism and length on their team plus having a great defensive coach. Now this strategy works on a lot of teams (my team unfortunately being an example of this) but not the celtics. The celtics don't get to the line and don't get to the rim, they rely a lot on more on midrangers and threes (Irving and Horford being some of the best guys at both and make a mean PnP duo). This game the bucks guard raised their intensity/compete level and made every single DHO and PnP/R harder for the celtics. But at the end of the day those shots are still available and the Kyrie/Horford PnP still got both guys decent shots in the 1st half. 


Offensively the bucks dealt with the Wall of defenders against Giannis drives by having giannis being a more willing passer (2 assists last game is embarrassing for him), using the PnP more often, and having their shooters space out even further (30 foot bombs stretches out this great Boston defence). The last part is what really opens up the bucks offence and limits the ability of the Boston help defenders (usually their athletic wings) from recovering on this giannis drives. The lineup change of Mirotic for Brown really helped this. The bucks will live or die with these long over the break threes. If theyre hitting them then the celtics help defenders have to stick closer to their men or help off the corners (I felt like the bucks got so much more corner threes this game).


Saying this don't get ahead of yourselves and say this series is over. Role players tend to play better at home and the bucks may not come out with this level of intensity and focus next game. Plus Stevens may go to even more Irving/Horford PnPs and force the bucks to stop dropping their bigs in the PnR. I still think this series is going 7 and will be amazing.",1
"I'm surprised not a lot of people mentioned him.

&amp;#x200B;

His style of play lends itself to longetivity. He can probably play into his 40's if he can still manage to run by that age.",1
He contributed heavily to the Bucks' run in the third. Two glaring plays in the third that don't show up on the boxscore: 1. an offensive charging foul because he was glacially slow on his drive; 2. drifted away from the corner and subsequently wasn't in place to receive a Kyrie kickout (the TO was on Kyrie).,1
Parents retired to Utah from Vancouver and I had some dealings with a few guys all Mormons (I do affiliate marketing). Couldn't even tell they were until I asked.

It would be one thing if this was the first time someone got injured against GSW. But at this point it's about the dozenth star.",0
"I really don't understand how none of those are fouls against the Celtics. Like the games over and I don't really give a shit, but they get clobbered on one end, then Giannis gets a soft call  immediately on the other end.

"As a former player and current high school varsity coach and referee, at the end of the day, the problem I see is that the NBA is a business that long ago decided (whether they were right or wrong is yet to be seen) that it would deviate from the purest form of basketball as a sport to what we see today. They decided that scoring was what the crowd wanted to see, so all of these changes have been made not necessarily with the end goal of ""protecting shooters"" or ""securing landing space"" but to enable more scoring. It's why they went so far as to change the rules to allow the ""gather step"" and creating defensive 3-second penalties. While I'd like to say that this focus on scoring makes the game painful to watch, somebody somewhere has decided this is the smarter business decision from a viewership standpoint. I love to see Harden, just like any other player, make basketball plays. I can't stand when Harden, and any other player, deviates from this. But until the NBA decides it wants what I would consider a better brand of basketball, I'll have to live with it, and seeing how many people argue that this style of play is ""quality basketball"", maybe I'm just in the minority. So while I get upset with what they're doing to my beloved sport, I can't say too much about how they're running their business.

Side note: I'd love to see them allow fights in basketball--maybe that'd discourage antics like this from people who can't back it up.

Edit: /s to the fighting. It's a terrible idea. It was a joke.",1
Do it before Friday!,1

I know he‚Äôs not the goat or anything but the amount of hate he gets is fucking ridiculous.",0
Giannis was exposed tonight at the playoff level. He can‚Äôt play against real playoff defenses. Bucks should try and trade to free up cap space and build around Brogdon and Middleton.,0
28-2 run without a timeout THANKS BRAD,1
"He might have not won the series but that was the best Lebron for me. The slashing, the footspeed, the skill. If he played like that for the rest of his career he would have been the undisputed GOAT, but age catches up to everyone. Personally, I think the return, jumpshooting Lebron was a lot worse than old Lebron iterations (slash and pass Lebron, LeBeef) but to each their own.",0

It‚Äôs clearly bothering him. Took him some time to adjust. I remember last year he jammed his finger in a game against the Lakers and bricked 3s the whole game and then hit 3 or 4 in OT lol. Just the way it goes.,1

Don't tell me he's not fouling him.",0

"Please take this one dimension talk out of my 3 dimension sub. But yes, Horford *exposed* him for just a game. Still need to play out the series",1
I mean if you REALLY wanted to you could convince yourself the one on LeBron was on purpose that but harden play was clearly a fluke,1
He obviously got hit but tried selling it again afterwards. Bhahaha.,0
Khris Middleton hates the Celtics,1
bruhhhh kyrie has to stop taking bad shots,1
 Bruh we still got like 6 minutes lol,1
That's such a weak call on Curry lol,1
Tough to win when you give up a 28-2 run,1
The amount of warriors fans that were calling him a bitch in the game thread. Oh boy,1
Bro look at his finger my guy,1
"oh look curry gets a foul called on him players who defend him 99% of the time never get called.

what's new though.",0
Khris Middleton would be top 5 ever if he only played playoff series vs Boston,1
Stay off the weeeeeeeeeeeee-duhhh,1
"Uhh you might want to watch the Middleton highlights from last year.  Dude was pulling up any time and hitting, legitimately did better than Giannis against us.

I was hoping it wasn't going to happen again but here we are.",1
Boston being only -5 w/ Middleton this hot is bothersome.,1
Stop. Bitching. About. Calls.,1
"Buddy doesn‚Äôt miss shots against us period. He‚Äôs a baller for sure, and this was a great response from the bucks after game 1. Should be a great series",1
So these refs gonna start calling fouls for the Celtics when we drive or should we just beat the Bucks and the Refs at the same time tonight and make them cry?,0
lmao what the fuck? Horford got smacked in the arm,1
Lol he's 3 years older than Ingram.,1
"So you understand people not wanting demographics that poll way less in support of free speech and the 2nd amendment just illegally cross the border and have anchor babies from that culture.  If you understand that politics effect people then you should understand why people don't want to stack the deck against themselves.  

And that is before getting into all the other problems. Like the fact that people say gentrification is a problem but poor Americans not being able to get a job because they can't speak a foreign language.  Or like Bernie Sanders says ""open borders is a Koch brothers proposal"" because illegals undercut poor Americans wages.  The list goes on and on.",0

"Anyone that wasn't taught to bring your body forward with momentum, never was a shooter. I'm not saying what Harden doesn't have intentions on making contact, he clearly does; but, SVP don't know shit if you think all shooters land in the exact spot, every time. Being wide open, like shown in the clip, is a relaxed shot and sometimes may not need that extra umph the contested shot needs.  

Just saying. As a Piston fan, Ish Smith needs that extra push and has a large jump forward. Depends and varies from player to player.

Bucks were up 7 with 5 minutes left in the 3rd q. Giannis then went on to score 11 of their next 13 points, with the only other bucket being an Ersan jumper after a Giannis drive and kick.

After that run he subbed out with 2 min left in the 3rd q with 28 points and Bucks up 18.

Enjoy the salt and try not to make shit up when you don't like reality.",1

This is embarassing lmao,1

"Not shitting on him. You put Tatum on a good team that allows for him to take open catch and shoots and better looks. He‚Äôll probably do better than Ingram in that setting. You hope for Tatum to get better at creating his own shot efficiently (harder to teach).

It's ok if Curry is hurt the Warriors still have Foster.,0
"Hell, if JR didn‚Äôt fuck up, there‚Äôs a chance they steal another game or so. JR completely broke LeBron, both mentally and physically (messed up his hand post game). Not to say Cavs had much of a chance anyways, but LeBron was insane that post season up until then. We were robbed some great performances.",1
"Draymond has punched LeBron in the groin in the 2016 finals, kicked Steven Adams in the balls on multiple seperate occasions, clawed LeBron in the eyes in the 2018 finals, headbutted Exum, elbowed and then hit Conley in the face, threw a knee at Evan Turner's face, jersey tackled Vince Carter, and the list goes on. 

If it was one time, it wouldn't be an issue. But clawing Harden in the face and taking him out of the game is a pattern. The Warriors are dirty af. They just don't have Zaza to take out Kawhi's ankles or go for Westbrook's knees anymore.",0
Well it‚Äôs not his shooting hand so that‚Äôs good. If they want he could just pop it back in and tape it.,1

"Also consider that unlike Football (soccer), the NBA is less of a political sport. For example, Liverpool is considered a socialist club, Jeremy Corbyn gets standing ovation in the emirates, Lazio and Leipzig has a big fascist wing that is somewhat tolerated by the club, and etc. So it's unlikely that non-income factors from their occupation would change their political views (perhaps maybe white players do learn more about systematic after playing in a predominantly african-american league and gain acquintances that have faced discrimination (i.e Sterling Brown)).",1

But I remember the officials throwing ticky-tack fouls on Grant and Sabonis in that Portland series like they were trying to get them out of the game early (Sabonis was a huge match-up problem for Shaq because he didn't need to double team Shaq and his range exposed Shaq's defensive weakness). 

And that game seven... they started the 4th quarter up by like 20, and the officials were just like... ""Nope.. you aren't allowed to score or play defense.""  They could do absolutely nothing without getting called for phantom fouls.  

I'll likely get down voted for this comment, but I really felt like the Kobe/Shaq Lakers would have only one in 2001 if the officiating was fair and square.",1

Here comes ref ball,1
You and I both know that‚Äôs a silly thing to say,0
Okay here‚Äôs a proposition: determine the outcome of this game via a 3P contest between dislocated finger Curry and blurry vision Harden,1
Please Allah I'm on my knees please let a fissure open up beneath Oracle and let these cancerous teams and fanbases be swallowed up by the earth.,0
"Don't work yourself into a shoot, brother.

Chris Paul has lost any physical advantage he ever had but he is still very cerebral and can execute an effective offensive plan .... mother fucking not. Dude is so washed and getting $$$$ for a longggggg time. Our poor cap.,0
Pinky and the brain! Reminds me of such simpler times.,1
That's the sound of thousands of toilets flushing now that the undercard is finished,0
Imagine facing the warriors on a cold 3 night for them when you‚Äôre having a good 3 night... but you‚Äôre stupid and give away 13 turnovers,1
Tatum needs to stop complaining after every missed shot...just play,1
So...does Houston know how to rebound at all??,1
"Crazy, today's NBA games is all about which team makes the most 3's.  If you are not making 3's you are not winning a NBA game.",1

giannis was overrated all along #exposed,0
You should stop posting dumb shit.,1

The Giannis steamroller play is the scariest thing in the NBA right now,1

Fuck the refs and everything but we played like complete shit as well,0
rip me then.  I guess i don't watch the nba.,0
Kyrie already has a ring. Harden and Giannis are the king of getting calls and don‚Äôt have a ring. What‚Äôs your point?,0
Kinda hard to play defense when you get called for a foul everytime down the court,0
Chris Paul mysteriously is gone with no explanation,1
Bucks fans are low key *really* good at being impartial and putting bias aside and acknowledging a foul when they see one or when a player is playing good defense,1
Has he even declared for the draft yet?,1
I heard he manicures his finger nails into a point In the playoffs. Not sure if true.,1
"Yes, rebounds are only for missed shot attempts. If you were clearly not trying to score, it's not a shot attempt, it's something else.",1
I love watching the clip.,1
Is Gordon Hayward a Trump supporter?,1
Fucking relax. I‚Äôm saying to me it looked like no one got him,0
It's part of the reason I don't think Harden should win MVP. This play can't be rewarded,1
Cursed picture. But Andris still only like 33. He was like 24 by the time he was out of the league after averaging double digit rebounds and everything. Dude‚Äôs free throws were absolutely fucked up because of confidence issues which eventually spread to his whole game. He‚Äôs like big man Fultz with the yips.,1
I‚Äôve never seen Draymond complain this little,1
"That's an interesting point, but have you considered Jaylen Brown?",1
"If it is, how long does it take to return from that?",1
No no no don‚Äôt speak that into existence!,1
Refs fuck rockets again,0
And a tetanus shot just to be extra sure,1
After this he stripped Harden who was trying to shoot and then got the offensive foul called on CP3,1
"No offense, but ‚Äúgive them hope‚Äù is pretty useless advice. How exactly are you supposed to do that? 

If there‚Äôs someone in your life who you think is struggling and you want to help them, just offer to hang out. Don‚Äôt phrase it in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here if you need anything‚Äù context. Don‚Äôt even bring up mental health unless they do. Just hang out, get lunch, talk about sports, old times, hobbies, whatever. Just be there. Remind them that you are there and that you care by actually being there and acting like you care. If they trust you, they may very well open up to you. And even if they don‚Äôt, just spending time with someone who seems like they actually care can do wonders when you‚Äôre feeling hopeless.",1

This gets me every time. Possibly funniest in game nba play ever,1
he had two surgeries on his knee and multiple doctors have said how it will be a problem long term.,1
Kyrie hasn‚Äôt shot a free throw all series. Fuck the refs,0
i swear Enes has said the almost the exact same things about OKC and NYK lmao.,1
Kyrie is literally having the same game giannis had last game so far,1
It‚Äôs game two against the best team. Pretty sure he wants to be out there,1
Russ would also have 10+ assists,1
And he does it by mocking them and the other players on the court. Bonafide bitch.,1
Their complete shit shooting does it,1
"turner should let that puppy loose then, they are in atlanta afterall, her canned accent isnt good",1

Secondly many people voted for Trump bc they believed Hillary was more corrupt, or they were concerned about the next supreme court picks. These are real, legitimate, appropriate reasons to vote that do not have one inkling of sexism/racism attached to them. I count myself among those on the right who are tired of these lazy arguments that slander us with no basis. Be nicer, and if you can't do that at least be logical. So far you have been neither.",0
He's already back in the game,1
He played well in that game just didn‚Äôt play aggressively with the ball.  Tonight he was pretty bad,0
"1 Jaylen Brown pls

-Pels fans",1
"I mean he didn't go to the line at all, so i understand why some people who doesn't watch the game and only look at box scores might say that.

Edit: yeah i know he likes to avoid fouls, that's why i said ""people who doesn't watch the game and only look at box scores"", it's pretty obvious if you watch the game.",1
The Warriors didn't even try last year so it went to 7 and you all thought it meant this series was gonna be close lmfao,0
Top 2 player and he‚Äôs not number 2,1
Harden got baby poked lol,1
Did you see the way harden landed just then? Didn't kick his feet out and try to land on the defender to draw the foul and he made it! Why can't he do that more often?,1
"So apparently 9pts 4rbs 1-4 fg 0-1 3pm is a good half.... 


Marv needs help.",1
"No but what LeBron does is prevent Kyrie from getting double teamed.

LeBron was legit MVP that year.,1
the best part about the playoffs is the salt,1
all season heard about harden travelling on his stepback and his FT but giannis travels everytime he brings the ball up and gets the call for running straight into guys lol,1
"Yep. In fact in his first season in Memphis (2014-15) he was averaging 2 less points, 1 less minute and played 10 less games. Nearly everything else is about the same.",1

I will don it with pride,1
That's like saying harden is low key growing a beard,1

This one is on Kyrie tbh. He tried to carry them out of a small hole and got everyone out of rhythm. Now they‚Äôre buried.,1
what is wrong with this sub and hating on young players,0
His flying elbows whenever he drives is worse,1
Yeah but the road team won game one in those first round series. Raptors won game 1,1
Bucks have been on a 121-95 run since the first quarter,1
Um is harden okay,1
"Damn, that was a nasty step back.",1
"Coaching and I'm sure experience.

He always seems to come back well after getting befuddled this year.. Miami limited him big time and he came out guns blazing the second time in MIA. Indy stopped him first time and then he had maybe the best game of his career against them the next time out before the all-star break.",1

Shumpert is insanely bad,1

Just like when he accidentally stepped on Mike Conley‚Äôs face,1
Who needs a stretcher for their eye?,1
"Agreed. The NBA needs to make changes very soon. I have been less and less interested in the NBA every year due to foul hunting. And it's reached a tipping point.

People will argue that you should do whatever you can to win. And there is truth to that. But this is also an entertainment product. And when players/teams decide the best way to play is to exploit bad rules and foul bait/flop, things need to change badly.",1

This is complete and utter horse shit. Kyrie had a rock implanted in his knee from a skateboarding accident when he was a kid. It's was a ticking time bomb from the get go. Kyrie has only had one injury to his knee.,0
you know that was more than 20 years ago?,1

America wins when the Celtics get blown out on national TV,1
"Because the statement of hating what CP and Harden have done because you liked Hakeem and Drexler makes it sound like the torch was passed from the former players to them. There‚Äôs no continuity there. 

I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs what they meant. But that‚Äôs why it sounds weird. I‚Äôm not bummed that Donovan Mitchell couldn‚Äôt get the Jazz past the first round cause I used to watch Stockton and Malone, ya know? They‚Äôre unrelated.",1
Middleton might steal a game. Meh. He won't steal a series.,0
Makes sense since Hayward is a racist.,0
I hate what harden and CP3 have done with the rockets. I was rooting for this team when Hakeem and Drexler were playing.,0
"Rockets fans really going to drum up this Harden ordeal for days, if not weeks, to come",0
Giannis before game: Let‚Äôs win big. Freaking win by 20.,1

Brooklyn reporter claims superstars are looking at Brooklyn,1
"Typical bad basketball officiating. Happens at all levels. I see it regularly in the NBA and I see it regularly in middle school.  A bumps B, causing B to either step out of bounds or lose the ball out of balls, ref isn't sure if A's contact was enough to be a foul, so the ref compromises and calls out of bounds on A, thus ironically ensuring that his call is definitely incorrect.",1

Not discounting him being a good player, but making 3s at a good clip as the second option doesn‚Äôt make you Steph. We took one on the road with his shooting; I consider that a win.",0
Why don't the celtics miss these wide open looks when they play the sixers?,1

Your other two reports have a whole lot of ""reportedly"" and ""according to officials"". No verifiable information, no direct sources. 

Try again. Lets talk policy. About race.",0
Not when you‚Äôve been balling as long as NBA players have.,1
Paul Pierce in shambles rn,1
Honestly that is my same line of thinking. I hate him when he overreacts to a call but he‚Äôs earned my respect as a player and as a man.,1
And then the next possession he got a strip on Harden's three point attempt to help force a shot clock violation. Really impressive to see him playing so well defensively.,1

"Nah it wasn't, Rockets had to play 4v5 on the following defensive possession",1
You all are missing context. Portland signed him to his previous $70 million contract. OKC just matched. So yeah the organization has been the best to him.,1

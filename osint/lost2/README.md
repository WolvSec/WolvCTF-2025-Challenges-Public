# Lost 2

`Author: dree`  
My other friend Johnny is somehow...worse. All I know is he is in the US, nothing else. He messaged me in January of this year saying "My flight took off just over a day and 2 hours late due to weather this SUCKS I could have driven there and back soooo many times by now" and "Sorry meant to send that last month lol airplane mode :PPP"  

There's no shot of finding him right? If you do pls send the flight number using the IATA code not ICAO thanks (Flag format: wctf{XX####})

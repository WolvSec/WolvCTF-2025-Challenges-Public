Looking at the image, the most important initial observation is the ATC tower. The presence of the tower tells you
that you are at an airport. An observation of lesser importance is the large FedEx building as well as the large
quantity of cargo and passenger aircraft that tell reveal that it is a major airport. Returning to the ATC tower,
seaching "us atc towers" will bring up some good links, most notable a wikipedia page of the tallest ATC towers.
This page lists shows that there are 5 airports with similarly designed ATC towers: Memphis, Salt Lake City, Newark,
Denver and Housten. Looking at the terminal, Denver can easily be eliminated as the image lacks the tent-like
architecture. Taking note of the rode near the POV of the image, Memphis can be eliminated as there are no highways
with concrete dividers in a location such that the ATC tower would be to the right of the FedEx. Additionally the
highway walls on that side block any view of the airport. Salt Lake City's airport lacks any off the greenery 
present in the image, and the only nearby locations with green lack divided roads. Taking note of the oddly
shaped building in the background of the image, Housten lacks any not perfectly rectangular buildings of notable
size near the airport thus eliminating it. This just leaves Newark. The ATC is North of the FedEx, meaning the
picture should've been taken from the East. There is a divided highway just east of the airport (NJ Turnpike),
and there is a oddly shaped Anheuser-Busch building West-Northwest of the airport that matches the shape and 
color of the building in the airport. As we know it was EWR, we can then go to a website like airplanes.live
or flightradar24 and playback to March 7th, 1:26/1:27 PM EST and find that only UA2050 departed EWR at that time.

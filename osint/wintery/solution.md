# Wintery Solution

The key feature of this challenge is the UofM flag on a building. After googling about this, you will notice that the Michigan Union building is the one in the image.

From there, you need to identify the building from which the picture was taken. The only building with the correct height relative to the angle the picture was taken is South Quad. 

In the image, you can see a small rooftop in the bottom right that indicates this picture was taken more towards the right of the South Quad building. Putting all this together, you can obtain the flag.

# Active: Domain Access
Oh no! Our beloved `wolvctf.corp` domain has been infiltrated!  How did they manage to break into our domain controller? Please figure out how they got access into the domain controller box, how a shell was achieved, and how a domain account was obtained. 

We have provided just the user accounts because the attacker did not cover their tracks very well.

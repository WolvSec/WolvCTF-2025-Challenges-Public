# Active 2: Lateral Movement

`Author: dree`  
The attacker moved laterally throughout our domain. I'm hearing reports from other members of wolvctf.corp that 3 lower level accounts were compromised (excluding the 2 higher level compromised accounts). Figure out which ones these are, and follow the attacker's steps to collect the flag.  

Users_Backup.zip's password is wolvctf

Flag is split up into 3 parts.

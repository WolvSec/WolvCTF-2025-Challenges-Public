# LockDown

I'm trying to use this adder, but I can't figure out what password gets it to work. Can you figure it out?  

NOTE: to get the flag, convert the password bit-string into an ASCII string, with password[47] as the MSB and password[0] as the LSB. For example, the password 01100101011110000110000101101101011100000110110001100101 would be converted to wctf{example}.

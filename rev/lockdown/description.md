I'm trying to use this adder, but I can't figure out what password gets it to work. Can you figure it out?

NOTE: to get the flag, convert the password bit-string into an ASCII string, with \_l47\_ as the MSB and _l0\_ as the LSB. For example, the password `01110111011000110111010001100110011110110110010101111000011000010110110101110000011011000110010101111101` would be converted to `wctf{example}`.

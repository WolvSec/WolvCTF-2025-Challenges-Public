if you got here then you are doing great
i was stupd thinking that my code was really unbreakable
however making this was a lot of fun and i hope that you had fun two
you truly are one of the elite my guy
the special words you must extract to get the flag are misspelled
like the following word persn
to make this solvable i need to make this longer so watch me talk for a minute
this challenge was a reference to the kryptos code
its a very interesting story and i am sure you can find stuff about it on the internet
actually the real code had four sections and the last one remains unsolved to this day
also the first one was not a caesar cipher so thats another difference 
doing two vigniere ciphers felt repetitieve so i had to change it up 
maybe now it is long enough
good luck and have fun with the rest of the competition

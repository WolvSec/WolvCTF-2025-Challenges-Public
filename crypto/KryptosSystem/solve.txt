This challenge is a reference to the Unbreakable Kryptos Code
It is comprised of 3 parts: k1, k2, k3
The Cipertexts shall be appended together with the transposition cipher in the middle  
The plaintext will hold instructions as to how to construct the flag

In reference to the Kryptos Code, the flag will be comprised of misspelled words

k1: basic rot13, this is meant to be mega easy
k2: transposition cipher
k3: vigniere cipher, but the kryptos alphabet

How to solve?
Frequency analysis will show that there are three parts to the challenge
The middle will correspond to an english alphabet, thus a transposition cipher
the top is literally rot13 
Then the name is a hint that this is the kryptos code
thus k3 is a vigniere cipher
